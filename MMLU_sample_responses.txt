Query 1: In July 1994 Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, was struck by 21 pieces of a comet  . When the fragments   landed in the southern part of the giant planet, the explosions were watched by scientists here on earth. But what if our own planet was hit by a comet? The year is 2094. It has been announced that a comet is heading towards the Earth. Most of it will miss our planet, but two fragments will probably hit the southern part of the Earth. The news has caused panic. On 17 July, a fragment four kilometers wide enters the Earth's atmosphere with a huge explosion. About half of the fragment is destroyed. But the major part survives and hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and an enormous wave is created and spreads. The wall of water rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometres an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned. The wave moves into the Indian Ocean and heads towards Asia. Millions of people are already dead in the southern part of the Earth, but the north won't escape for long. Tons of broken pieces are thrown into the atmosphere by the explosions. As the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero. Crops are ruined. Wars break out as countries fight for food. A year later civilization has collapsed. No more than 10 million people have survived. Could it really happen? In fact, it has already happened more than once in the history of the Earth. The dinosaurs were on the Earth for over 160 million years. Then 65 million years ago they suddenly disappeared. Many scientists believe that the Earth was hit by a space fragment. The dinosaurs couldn't survive in the cold climate that followed and they became extinct. Will we meet the same end? 56.Why does the author mention dinosaurs at the end of the passage?
A) Because they could only live in the warm climate
B) Because their extinction indicates future disasters
C) Because they once dominated the earth
D) Because dinosaurs and humans never live in the same age

The correct answer is: B) Because their extinction indicates future disasters

All answer choices:
1. A) Because they could only live in the warm climate
2. B) Because their extinction indicates future disasters
3. C) Because they once dominated the earth
4. D) Because dinosaurs and humans never live in the same age


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is B) Because their extinction indicates future disasters.

The correct answer is B

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The author mentions dinosaurs at the end of the passage to draw a parallel between their extinction and the potential future extinction of humans due to a similar catastrophic event, such as a comet impact. The passage discusses a hypothetical scenario where a comet fragment hits Earth, causing widespread destruction and leading to the collapse of civilization. The author uses the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago as an example of a past event where a space fragment may have caused a catastrophic change in climate, leading to the extinction of a dominant species. Therefore, the author is suggesting that humans could face a similar fate if a comet were to hit Earth in the future.

The correct answer is B) Because their extinction indicates future disasters.

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the passage and options carefully.

The author mentions dinosaurs at the end of the passage to make a comparison between the hypothetical scenario of a comet hitting the Earth and a real event in the Earth's history. The author is suggesting that just as the dinosaurs became extinct after a massive space impact, humans might also face extinction if a similar event were to occur.

Option A is incorrect because the author does not mention the climate that dinosaurs lived in. Option C is also incorrect because while it is true that dinosaurs dominated the Earth, this is not the reason the author mentions them. Option D is incorrect because humans and dinosaurs did coexist, but only for a short period of time.

The correct answer is B) Because their extinction indicates future disasters

minister3:
The author mentions dinosaurs to draw a parallel between their extinction caused by a comet impact and the potential future disaster that could befall humans. This comparison underscores the idea that a similar catastrophic event could lead to the collapse of civilization, as the dinosaurs' extinction was a result of the environmental changes following the impact. The mention serves to emphasize the real historical precedent for such disasters and their devastating consequences.  
The correct answer is B

president:
The author mentions dinosaurs at the end of the passage to draw a parallel between the extinction of the dinosaurs and the potential scenario described. Dinosaurs, like the fictional comet impact, faced a catastrophic event that led to their extinction. This comparison serves to highlight the potential consequences of a similar disaster happening in the future, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation.

The correct answer is B

Query 2: Finding time to enjoy life is becoming harder and harder. As the average workweek lengthens, leisure time drops. Yet some of the world's busiest people are able to develop rewarding careers and also make time for family and leisure activities. Here is their best advice plus that of time-management experts: 1. Use your peak hours wisely. People tend to be most alert in late morning and midevening. Afternoon brings an increase in sleepiness. Use your high-efficiency hours to handle difficult jobs or engage in creative thinking. For low-efficiency times, concentrate on cleaning up or sorting your mail. By adapting to your mental condition, you can accomplish more in less time. 2. Make a plan. Just 20 minutes of organizing can save an hour of extra effort remembering what must be done. "Don't try to carry your life around in your head," says Lucy Hedrick, author of Five Days to an Organized Life. "Write things down so you can free your brain for more inventive pursuit  ." 3. Discourage drop-ins. The person who welcomes every visitor will get plenty of conversation but won't accomplish much. The trick is to develop harmless ways to protect yourself from minute-stealing interruptions. David E. Levy, a public-relations consultant  , uses an alternative to the open-door policy by keeping his door half open. The message is clear: he really doesn't want you to come in, but you can if it is important. 4. Tame   the telephone. Few devices save more minutes--or waste so many more--than the telephone. Signal the end of your conversation with a phrase such as "Before we hang up..." You can save even more time by not taking every incoming call. Keep a record of when people you call regularly are least busy and call them at those times. Even better, make appointments to call important contacts. To help us gain an extra hour every day, a clockmaker in Dallas has created a timer measuring each minute at 57.6 seconds. The 2.5 seconds borrowed from each minute add up to an extra 60 minutes at the end of each day. Who works most efficiently according to the passage?
A) An editor who is trying to produce a title for his article in the afternoon.
B) A manager who is designing selling plans with his office door open.
C) A visitor to a mayor without making an appointment.
D) A student in class without taking any incoming calls.

minister1:
The passage discusses various strategies for time management and efficiency. Let's analyze each option:

A) An editor who is trying to produce a title for his article in the afternoon.
- The passage advises using peak hours for difficult jobs or creative thinking. Afternoon is mentioned as a time of increased sleepiness, which is not ideal for high-efficiency tasks.

B) A manager who is designing selling plans with his office door open.
- The passage advises against welcoming every visitor to avoid interruptions. A manager with an open door policy is likely to be interrupted frequently, which would not be efficient.

C) A visitor to a mayor without making an appointment.
- The passage advises against drop-ins and suggests making appointments to minimize interruptions. A visitor without an appointment is likely to be seen as a drop-in and could disrupt the mayor's schedule.

D) A student in class without taking any incoming calls.
- The passage advises taming the telephone to save time. A student in class without taking incoming calls is following this advice, which would make them more efficient.

The correct answer is D.

minister2:
To determine who works most efficiently according to the passage, let's analyze the options:

A) An editor who is trying to produce a title for his article in the afternoon: The passage suggests that the afternoon is a low-efficiency time, as people tend to feel sleepier during this period. This option does not align with the advice to use peak hours wisely.

B) A manager who is designing selling plans with his office door open: This option contradicts the advice to discourage drop-ins and develop harmless ways to protect oneself from minute-stealing interruptions. A manager who welcomes every visitor will not accomplish much.

C) A visitor to a mayor without making an appointment: This option also contradicts the advice to discourage drop-ins and make appointments to call important contacts.

D) A student in class without taking any incoming calls: This option aligns with the advice to not take every incoming call and make appointments to call important contacts. It also implies that the student is focused on their classwork, which is a high-priority task.

Query 3: A tropical   rain forest is an amazing place. Thousands of different kinds of plants and animals make their homes there. Some are not found anywhere else in the world. If the rain forests are not protected, some species of plants and animals could disappear forever, taking their resources   with them. Scientists have known for a long time that medical cures can come from plants. The rain forest is the perfect habitat for various types of plants. They compete for space, sunlight, water, and nutrients. The plants that survive are strong. They also contain many types of chemicals. These chemicals are part of the plants' defence system. They can help protect the plants from bacteria, insects, diseases, and other threats. Experts believe that some of these chemicals might be useful to human beings, too. The native people of the rain forests have healers   who help those who are sick. For hundreds of years, they have known which leaves, roots, and berries can be used to treat different illnesses. Western scientists have begun working with these native healers. They learn about different plants, cures, and treatments. Then, they can perform tests on the plants to see what chemicals they contain and how they might be used. When they do find something important, it goes through more and more tests. Lots of experiments must be done over a long period of time before something can be safely sold as a drug. Scientists want to be sure that it works and that the risk of using it isn't too high. American scientists have set up labs in the countries where the rain forests are. They do studies and research there. They also employ scientists and workers who live in these countries to help them. This allows the local people to benefit from research on the rain forests. They can make money from the rain forest without destroying it, which is very important. If the rain forest is valuable to them, they will help protect it. The more people who are trying to protect the rain forests, the better. Just imagine the cures that might be found there! What can we infer from the text?
A) The natives don't know the value of the plants.
B) The rain forests are beneficial to the entire world.
C) People show little interest in protecting the rain forests.
D) Cures for dangerous diseases have been found in the rain forests.

collaborative Response:
The correct answer is B) The rain forests are beneficial to the entire world.

The correct answer is B

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The text discusses the importance of rain forests and the potential for medical cures derived from plants found there. It highlights the collaboration between Western scientists and native healers, the rigorous testing process for new drugs, and the economic benefits for local communities from rain forest research. The text also emphasizes the need for protection of rain forests to preserve biodiversity and potential medical resources.

The correct answer is B) The rain forests are beneficial to the entire world.

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the text carefully.

The text highlights the importance of rain forests, mentioning that they are home to thousands of different kinds of plants and animals, some of which are found nowhere else in the world. It also emphasizes the potential of the rain forest to provide medical cures and benefits to human beings. The text describes how scientists are working with native healers to learn about different plants, cures, and treatments, and how this collaboration allows the local people to benefit from research on the rain forests.

Option A, "The natives don't know the value of the plants," is incorrect because the text actually states that the native people have known for hundreds of years which leaves, roots, and berries can be used to treat different illnesses, indicating that they do have knowledge of the value of the plants.

Option C, "People show little interest in protecting the rain forests," is also incorrect because the text states that the more people who are trying to protect the rain forests, the better, indicating that there is interest in protecting the rain forests.

Option D, "Cures for dangerous diseases have been found in the rain forests," is not entirely accurate because the text does not state that cures have been found, but rather that scientists are working to find them.

Option B, "The rain forests are beneficial to the entire world," is the most accurate inference from the text. The text highlights the importance of the rain forests, mentioning that they are home to thousands of different kinds of plants and animals, and that they have the potential to provide medical cures and benefits to human beings.

The correct answer is B

minister3:
The text discusses the importance of tropical rain forests in harboring diverse plant and animal species, some of which have potential medicinal value. It highlights the collaboration between Western scientists and native healers to study these plants, the necessity of extensive testing before drugs can be safely used, and the idea that local communities can benefit economically from research, thereby incentivizing their protection. These points collectively emphasize the global significance of rain forests, as their resources could benefit humanity while also being valuable to local populations.

1. A) bark and canopies
2. B) a crystal lake
3. C) a snowy mountaintop
4. D) a small bird


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is A) bark and canopies.

The correct answer is A

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The question describes a process where a tiny spark grows and spreads, consuming an area of nature. This is a clear description of a wildfire. Wildfires typically start in forests or grasslands and spread through the vegetation, consuming trees, shrubs, and other plant life. They do not typically start in or spread through a crystal lake, a snowy mountaintop, or a small bird.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
The correct answer is A

minister2:
To analyze this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The question describes a tiny spark that grows and spreads through an area of nature, consuming something in its path.
2. The options provided are: A) bark and canopies, B) a crystal lake, C) a snowy mountaintop, and D) a small bird.
3. Considering the description of a spark growing and spreading, it suggests a natural phenomenon such as a wildfire.
4. Wildfires are known to consume vegetation, including bark and canopies of trees.
5. The other options, such as a crystal lake, a snowy mountaintop, and a small bird, are less likely to be consumed by a growing spark or wildfire.

Based on this analysis, the most logical conclusion is that the spark is likely a wildfire that consumes bark and canopies.

The correct answer is A

minister3:
The sentence describes a spark initiating a destructive process that spreads through a natural area and mountains. A spark typically ignites flammable materials like vegetation, which would include bark and canopies. While a crystal lake (B) or snowy mountaintop (C) could be affected by fire, they are not as directly consumed by a spark as plant matter. A small bird (D) is an individual organism, not a broad natural area. The most logical and contextually accurate option is A) bark and canopies, as they represent flammable plant materials that a fire could spread through. 

The correct answer is A

president:
The correct answer is A) bark and canopies.

Query 6: One of the hardest things to do when you are a small child is to start school, and have a new teacher every year. I remember when I was in fourth grade, there were tons of rumors   about my teacher. They said that he would hit kids with erasers. _ , and to this day I still remember him as one of those people who really helped me in life. One of the things that you can do to help your kids get ready for a new teacher is to go to meet him or her before the year starts. This allows students to know who the teacher is, and break the ice. It is common for students to be fearful of the teacher for the first few days. Maybe they look scary  . However, as a parent, you need to teach your kids that teachers are people too, and that they want nothing but the best for you in life. If your child is still having trouble adjusting to   a teacher, you could ask your child to be taught by a different teacher. Adjusting to teachers can be an uncertain thing for a young child. Whether your child knows nothing about this person, or maybe he has heard a rumor about him, it can be a scary thing. As a parent, all you can do is to make sure that your children know the teacher is there to help, not be scary. When the author was in the fourth grade, he   _  .

Query 7: Are extraverts really better leaders? Can an introvert be a good leader? Research has shown a consistent positive relationship between extraversion and leadership. In groups of strangers,such as a jury , extraversion predicts who will be selected foreperson of the jury. It's actually likely to be the person who talks the most,and that person is probably an extravert. So, extraverts are more likely to be chosen for leadership positions  (what we call leader "emergence"). There is also a positive relationship (although a weaker one) between extraversion and leader effectiveness, particularly evaluated effectiveness of leaders. So it appears that extraverts have _ an _ edge, _ but does this mean that introverts can't be good leaders?  Of course not ! Many successful leaders are introverted, for example Abraham Lincoln, Gandhi, and in business, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. One of the best company presidents that I've known was easily the most introverted person among his executive team, but he was very successful and his colleagues admired his "quiet reserve and confidence". So what is the critical factor that both extraverts and introverts need to emerge as a leader and to be effective? Our research has  suggested that the key element is good interpersonal, or social, skills. In one study,we looked at the relationship of extraversion to leadership emergence and effectiveness and found that the advantage that extraverts had disappeared when we put social skills into the equation . In other words,only extraverts who possessed social skills were effective leaders. Good interpersonal skills are critical whether the leader is an extravert or an introvert. In addition,we know that we are more likely to choose leaders who look like their prototypes of leaders--they speak well, interact well with others, and just look "leader-like".  Extraverts just naturally look more like a prototypical  leader, particularly political  leaders, than  do  introverts. Think of the U.S. presidential  campaign where presidential hopefuls were evaluated for how much each looked like he or she could be the Commander-in-Chief. The key to leadership success then is to develop the people skills needed to look like a leader, but to also develop the good leader-follower relationships that are necessary for success. If you possess these skills,introversion and extraversion don't matter very much. What can we infer from the passage?
A) There is a positive relationship between introversion and leadership.
B) The more introverted leaders in a team are,the more admired they will be.
C) Good interpersonal skills play a key role in making people effective leaders.
D) Political leaders are more likely to be extroverts than introverts.


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: C) Good interpersonal skills play a key role in making people effective leaders.

All answer choices:
1. A) There is a positive relationship between introversion and leadership.
2. B) The more introverted leaders in a team are,the more admired they will be.
3. C) Good interpersonal skills play a key role in making people effective leaders.
4. D) Political leaders are more likely to be extroverts than introverts.


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is C) Good interpersonal skills play a key role in making people effective leaders.

The correct answer is C

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The passage discusses the relationship between extraversion and leadership, and it highlights that while extraverts may have an edge in leadership emergence and effectiveness, introverts can also be successful leaders. The key factor for effective leadership, according to the passage, is good interpersonal or social skills. This means that both extraverts and introverts can be effective leaders if they possess these skills.

The passage does not explicitly state that there is a positive relationship between introversion and leadership (Option A), nor does it suggest that introverted leaders are more admired (Option B). It does not directly compare the likelihood of political leaders being extroverts or introverts (Option D). However, it does emphasize the importance of good interpersonal skills in making people effective leaders (Option C).

Therefore, the correct answer is:
C) Good interpersonal skills play a key role in making people effective leaders.

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the passage carefully. The passage discusses the relationship between extraversion and leadership, stating that there is a consistent positive relationship between the two. However, it also emphasizes that introverts can be good leaders, citing examples of successful introverted leaders. The critical factor that both extraverts and introverts need to emerge as a leader and to be effective is good interpersonal or social skills. The passage suggests that only extraverts who possess social skills are effective leaders, and that good interpersonal skills are critical for leadership success.

Now, let's examine the options:

A) There is a positive relationship between introversion and leadership. This is not supported by the passage, which states that there is a positive relationship between extraversion and leadership.

B) The more introverted leaders in a team are, the more admired they will be. This is not supported by the passage, which mentions that an introverted company president was admired for his "quiet reserve and confidence", but does not suggest that introverts are more likely to be admired than extraverts.

C) Good interpersonal skills play a key role in making people effective leaders. This is directly supported by the passage, which states that good interpersonal skills are critical for leadership success and that only extraverts who possess social skills are effective leaders.

D) Political leaders are more likely to be extroverts than introverts. This is not supported by the passage, which suggests that extraverts may look more like prototypical leaders, but does not imply that they are more likely to be chosen as leaders.

The correct answer is C

minister3:
The passage discusses the relationship between extraversion and leadership, noting that while extraverts are more likely to emerge as leaders due to their natural tendency to be vocal and socially perceived as prototypical leaders, the key to effective leadership lies in good interpersonal skills. It explicitly states that when social skills are considered, the advantage of extraversion disappears, emphasizing their critical role regardless of personality type. 

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not claim a positive relationship between introversion and leadership, only that introverts can be successful leaders.  
Option B is not supported, as the admiration of introverted leaders is mentioned in a specific context, not as a general trend.  
Option D is partially true but not the main inference; the passage focuses on the perception of leadership prototypes rather than asserting a statistical likelihood.  
Option C is directly supported by the research findings and the conclusion that interpersonal skills are essential for leadership effectiveness.  

The correct answer is C

Query 8: It was a beautiful day at the beach--blue sky, gentle wind, calm sea.I knew these things because a man sitting five feet from me was shouting them into his mobile phone, like a play-by-play announcer  . "IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY," he shouted."THE SKY IS BLUE, AND THERE'S A GENTLE WIND, AND THE WATER IS CALM, AND..." Behind me, a woman, her mobile phone pressed to her ear was walking back and forth. "She DIDN'T," she was saying."No.She DIDN'T.She DID? Really? Are you SERIOUS? She did NOT.She DID? No she..." And so on.This woman had two children, who were playing in the sea.I found myself watching them, because the woman surely was not.A huge squid could have caught and snatched the children, and this woman would not have noticed.Or, if she had noticed, she'd have said, "Listen.I have to go, because a huge squid just......No! She didn't ! She DID? No! She......" And next to me, the play-by-play man would have said: "...AND A HUGE SQUID JUST ATE TWO CHILDREN, AND I'M GETTING A LITTLE SUNBURNED, AND ..." It used to be that the major trouble at the beach was the fellow who brought a boom box   and turned it up so loud that the bass notes caused seagulls to explode.But at least you knew where these fellows were; you never know which beachgoers have mobile phones.You'll settle next to what appears to be a sleeping sunbather, or even (you hope) a _ , and you'll lie happily on your towel, and you'll get all the way to the second sentence of your 467-page book before you fall asleep to the hypnotic surge of the surf  , and ... BREEP! BREEP! The corpse sits up, feels urgently for its mobile phone, and shouts "Hello! I'm at the beach! Yes! It's nice! Very peaceful! What? She did? No, she didn't! She DID? No, she..." Loud mobile-phoners never seem to get urgent calls.Just once, I'd like to hear one of them say, "Hello? Yes, this is Dr.Johnson.Oh, Dr.Smith.You've opened the abdominal cavity  ? Good! Now the appendix should be right under the ... What? No, that's the liver.Don't take THAT out, ha ha! Oh, you did? My God! OK, now listen carefully..."

A) had a wonderful holiday at the beach
B) must have suffered a lot because of the terrible weather
C) is only interested in talks by doctors about operation
D) experienced an unhappy holiday at the beach


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: D) experienced an unhappy holiday at the beach

All answer choices:
1. A) had a wonderful holiday at the beach
2. B) must have suffered a lot because of the terrible weather
3. C) is only interested in talks by doctors about operation
4. D) experienced an unhappy holiday at the beach


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is D) experienced an unhappy holiday at the beach.

The correct answer is D

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The writer of the passage is expressing frustration and annoyance with beachgoers who use their mobile phones excessively, particularly those who shout into their phones and those who are so engrossed in their conversations that they don't notice their surroundings. The writer is not enjoying the beach due to these distractions, so the correct answer is:

The correct answer is D) experienced an unhappy holiday at the beach

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the passage and options carefully.

The passage describes a scene at the beach where the writer is surrounded by people using their mobile phones to have loud and unnecessary conversations. The writer is frustrated with this behavior and uses it as a backdrop to comment on the changing nature of social interactions and the impact of mobile phones on public spaces.

Option A) "had a wonderful holiday at the beach" is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the writer had a wonderful time. Instead, the writer is annoyed by the loud mobile phone conversations and the lack of attention from parents to their children.

Option B) "must have suffered a lot because of the terrible weather" is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that it was a beautiful day at the beach, with a blue sky, gentle wind, and calm sea.

Option C) "is only interested in talks by doctors about operation" is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the writer is interested in medical conversations. The example of a doctor's conversation is used as a humorous way to contrast with the typical mobile phone conversations.

Option D) "experienced an unhappy holiday at the beach" is the most accurate description of the passage. The writer's tone and language suggest that they are frustrated and annoyed by the behavior of the people around them, which implies that they did not have a pleasant experience at the beach.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The passage describes a seemingly idyllic beach setting with a blue sky, gentle wind, and calm sea, but the narrator's focus is on the disruptive behavior of people using mobile phones. The tone is critical and annoyed, highlighting the irritation caused by the man's play-by-play commentary and the woman's frantic, repetitive dialogue. The narrator expresses concern for the children's safety due to the woman's distraction, and even humorously imagines a scenario where a squid could harm them without her noticing. The comparison to the boom box problem (which was a known annoyance) underscores the frustration with mobile phones. The final mention of wishing for an urgent medical call instead of the current situation further emphasizes the narrator's dissatisfaction. The overall sentiment is negative, indicating an unhappy experience rather than a pleasant one. 

The correct answer is D

Query 9: Americans with small families own a small car or a large one. If both parents are working, they usually have two cars. When the family is large, one of the cars is sold and they will buy a van  . A small car can hold   four persons and a large car can hold six persons but it is very crowded . A van hold seven persons easily, so a family with three children could ask their grandparents to go on a holiday travel. They could all travel together. Mr Hagen and his wife had a third child last year. This made them sell a second car and bought a van. The sixth and seventh seat are used to put other things, for a family of five must carry many suitcases  when they travel. When they arrive at their grandparents' home, the suitcases are brought into the home and the two seats can then carry the grandparents. Americans call vans motor homes. A motor home is always used for holidays. When a family are traveling to the mountains or to the seaside, they can live in their motor home for a few days or weeks. All the members of a big family can enjoy a happier life when they are traveling together. That is why motor homes have become very popular. In   America there are many parks for motor homes. Motor homes have become popular because  _
A) they can take people to another city when people are free
B) they can let families have a happier life when they go out for their holidays
C) some people think motor homes are cheap
D) big families can put more things in motor homes


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: B) they can let families have a happier life when they go out for their holidays

All answer choices:
1. A) they can take people to another city when people are free
2. B) they can let families have a happier life when they go out for their holidays
3. C) some people think motor homes are cheap
4. D) big families can put more things in motor homes


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is B.

The correct answer is B

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The question is asking why motor homes have become popular in America. The text provides several reasons, but the most significant one is that they allow big families to travel together and enjoy a happier life. This is explicitly stated in the sentence: "All the members of a big family can enjoy a happier life when they are traveling together. That is why motor homes have become very popular."

The other options are not supported by the text:
- A) is not mentioned in the text.
- B) is mentioned, but it's not the main reason given.
- C) is not mentioned in the text.
- D) is mentioned, but it's not the main reason given.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is B

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided in the passage.

The passage explains how Americans with large families often sell one of their cars and buy a van, which they call a motor home. The motor home is used for holidays, and it allows the family to travel together, carrying all their suitcases and even grandparents. The passage highlights the convenience and comfort of motor homes for big families.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A) They can take people to another city when people are free - This option is not supported by the passage. The passage does not mention motor homes being used for transportation between cities.

B) They can let families have a happier life when they go out for their holidays - This option is consistent with the passage. The passage states that motor homes have become popular because they allow big families to travel together and enjoy a happier life.

C) Some people think motor homes are cheap - This option is not supported by the passage. The passage does not mention the cost of motor homes.

D) Big families can put more things in motor homes - This option is partially correct, but it's not the main reason why motor homes have become popular. The passage does mention that motor homes can carry many suitcases, but it's not the primary reason for their popularity.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is B

minister3:
The passage explains that motor homes (vans) have become popular because they allow large families to travel together more comfortably, enabling all members to enjoy a happier life during holidays. While it mentions the capacity to carry suitcases and the ability to transport more people, these are supporting details that lead to the main conclusion about family happiness. The key sentence, "That is why motor homes have become very popular," directly links the popularity to the improved family experience during travel. 

The correct answer is B

Query 10: Congress enacted a law prohibiting the killing, capture, or removal of any form of wildlife upon or from any federally owned land. Which of the following is the most easily justifiable source of national authority for this federal law?
A) The commerce clause of Article I, Â§ 8. 
B) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV.
C) The enforcement clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
D) The property clause of Article IV, Â§ 3


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: D) The property clause of Article IV, Â§ 3

All answer choices:
1. A) The commerce clause of Article I, Â§ 8. 
2. B) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV.
3. C) The enforcement clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
4. D) The property clause of Article IV, Â§ 3


collaborative Response:
The most easily justifiable source of national authority for the federal law prohibiting the killing, capture, or removal of wildlife on federally owned land is the property clause of Article IV, Section 3. This clause explicitly grants Congress the power to regulate activities on land belonging to the United States, providing a direct and clear constitutional basis for the law.

The correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
To determine the most easily justifiable source of national authority for the federal law prohibiting the killing, capture, or removal of wildlife upon or from any federally owned land, we need to analyze the specific clauses mentioned in the options:

A) The commerce clause of Article I, § 8: This clause gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states. While it could potentially be used to justify federal regulation of wildlife, it is not the most direct or straightforward source of authority for this specific law.

B) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV: This clause deals with the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States in other states. It does not directly relate to the regulation of wildlife on federal land.

C) The enforcement clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: This clause gives Congress the power to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, which includes the due process and equal protection clauses. While it could be argued that the regulation of wildlife on federal land could be related to these principles, it is not the most direct source of authority.

D) The property clause of Article IV, § 3: This clause states that Congress has the power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the property of the United States. This clause directly relates to the regulation of wildlife on federally owned land, as it gives Congress the authority to make rules and regulations regarding the property of the United States.

Therefore, the most easily justifiable source of national authority for the federal law prohibiting the killing, capture, or removal of wildlife upon or from any federally owned land is the property clause of Article IV, § 3.

The correct answer is D.

minister2:
To determine the most easily justifiable source of national authority for the federal law prohibiting the killing, capture, or removal of any form of wildlife upon or from any federally owned land, we need to analyze the options provided.

Option A, the commerce clause of Article I, Â§ 8, is typically used to justify federal laws that regulate interstate commerce. While wildlife conservation might have some indirect effects on commerce, it is not the most direct or obvious source of national authority for a law regulating wildlife on federally owned land.

Option B, the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, is primarily used to protect the rights of citizens of one state from discrimination by another state. This clause does not directly relate to the regulation of wildlife on federally owned land.

Option C, the enforcement clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, is used to enforce the provisions of the amendment, primarily dealing with equal protection and due process. This clause does not directly relate to the regulation of wildlife on federally owned land.

Option D, the property clause of Article IV, Â§ 3, states that Congress has the power to make laws for the acquisition and disposal of property owned by the federal government. This clause directly relates to the regulation of wildlife on federally owned land, as the law in question is regulating wildlife on land owned by the federal government.

Given the analysis of the options, the most easily justifiable source of national authority for the federal law prohibiting the killing, capture, or removal of any form of wildlife upon or from any federally owned land is the property clause of Article IV, Â§ 3.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The correct answer is D) The property clause of Article IV, Â§ 3. 

Congress's authority to regulate wildlife on federally owned land stems from its power to manage and control federal property, as outlined in the property clause. This clause grants Congress the authority to "dispose of" and "regulate" land owned by the United States, which directly supports the enactment of laws protecting wildlife on such lands. While the commerce clause (A) could justify regulations affecting interstate commerce, the question specifies wildlife on federal property, making the property clause the more direct and relevant source of authority. The privileges and immunities clause (B) and enforcement clause (C) are unrelated to property regulation. 

The correct answer is D

The correct answer is D.

Query 11: It was a week before Christmas, but things were far from cheery. Our task was to deliver as many boxes of food as possible to those in need in Camden, New Jersey. There were no Christmas carolers   walking these streets that were lined with boarded-up   houses and broken windows. Mothers kept their children close as they hurried down the streets.  It was mid-afternoon, but even the bright sun couldn't warm this place. Red tickets in the windows marked which houses we were to visit. Our white truck stopped in front of one townhouse and our group knocked on the door. In our arms were boxes filled with ham, bread and other essentials to make the perfect Christmas dinner. Four small faces glanced through the curtains and one exhausted mom answered the door. She seemed embarrassed to be caught in her nightgown with undone hair. She was in her mid-20s, but her rough skin and tired eyes added years. "Sacred Heart food delivery service," I smiled. "Where can we put this for you?" She pointed and as we entered the house, I noticed the conditions they lived in. The children climbed around, wearing only diapers  . There were no carpets, only cold concrete beneath our feet. There was no Christmas tree or decorations. My heart sank. It was so cold, and I found it hard to believe that this was reality for this family. We set the boxes down and the mother grabbed my hand. "You don't know how much of a blessing this is to me and my family," she said, crying. _ I opened my arms and gave her a hug. "Happy holidays!" I replied before I headed out the door. I realized how warm I felt inside. This was unlike anything I had ever experienced. We cannot help what family we are born into, but we can help each other. By saying "We are just getting by", the woman meant   _  .
A) they were waiting for help
B) they were looking for food and clothing
C) they were going to move away
D) they were living a very poor life

The correct answer is D) they were living a very poor life.

The correct answer is D

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The passage describes a scenario where a family is in dire need of food and basic necessities. The mother, who is in her mid-20s, is exhausted and embarrassed, and her children are wearing only diapers. The house is cold and lacks basic amenities like carpets, Christmas decorations, and a Christmas tree. The family is living in very poor conditions, and the mother's statement "We are just getting by" indicates that they are barely surviving and are in desperate need of assistance. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is D) they were living a very poor life

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context of the passage. The passage describes a scene where a group is delivering food to a family in need in Camden, New Jersey, a place with many boarded-up houses and broken windows. The family they visit lives in a townhouse with no carpets, cold concrete floors, and no Christmas decorations. The mother is exhausted, and the children are wearing only diapers. This suggests that the family is struggling to make ends meet and is likely living in poverty.

The mother's statement "You don't know how much of a blessing this is to me and my family" indicates that they are grateful for the food delivery, implying that they are struggling to get by. The passage also states that the mother said "You don't know how much of a blessing this is to me and my family" while crying, which further emphasizes their gratitude and desperation.

Given this context, the correct answer is the one that best captures the idea that the family is struggling to get by.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The passage describes a family in dire need, living in a poorly maintained townhouse with children wearing only diapers and no Christmas decorations. The mother's statement, "We are just getting by," reflects her acknowledgment of their difficult circumstances. This phrase typically indicates that someone is barely managing to survive with limited resources, which aligns with the description of their living conditions. While options A and B suggest seeking help, the phrase does not imply they are waiting or actively looking for assistance. Option C is not supported by the text. The most accurate interpretation is that they are enduring a life of poverty.

Query 12: A tuna is an ocean fish that is well adapted to catching small, fast-moving prey. Which of the following adaptations most helps a tuna swim fast to catch its prey?
A) large fins
B) sharp teeth
C) small gills
D) tough scales


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: A) large fins

All answer choices:
1. A) large fins
2. B) sharp teeth
3. C) small gills
4. D) tough scales


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is D

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
To determine which adaptation helps a tuna swim fast to catch its prey, we need to consider the physiological and anatomical features that would enhance speed and agility in water.

- **Large fins**: While fins are important for maneuvering and stability, they are not the primary adaptation for speed.
- **Sharp teeth**: Teeth are crucial for catching and holding prey, but they do not directly contribute to swimming speed.
- **Small gills**: Small gills are more efficient for extracting oxygen from water at high speeds, which is beneficial for fast swimming.
- **Tough scales**: Tough scales provide protection and streamline the body, but they do not directly enhance swimming speed.

Given these points, the adaptation that most helps a tuna swim fast to catch its prey is small gills, as they allow for efficient oxygen extraction at high speeds.

The correct answer is C.

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the options and the characteristics of tuna.

Tuna are known for their speed and agility in the water, which allows them to catch small, fast-moving prey. To achieve this, they need to be able to move quickly and efficiently through the water.

Option A, large fins, is a plausible adaptation for swimming fast. Fins are used for propulsion and maneuverability in fish, and larger fins would provide more surface area to push against the water, allowing the tuna to move faster.

Option B, sharp teeth, is an adaptation for catching and eating prey, but it is not directly related to swimming speed.

Option C, small gills, is not a likely adaptation for swimming fast. Gills are used for respiration, and their size would not directly affect a fish's swimming speed.

Option D, tough scales, provides protection against predators and the environment, but it is not directly related to swimming speed.

Based on this analysis, the adaptation that most helps a tuna swim fast to catch its prey is large fins, which provide the necessary propulsion and maneuverability for speed.

The correct answer is A

minister3:
The question asks which adaptation most helps a tuna swim fast to catch prey. Tuna are known for their speed, which is primarily achieved through efficient propulsion. Large fins, particularly the caudal (tail) fin, play a crucial role in generating thrust and maintaining stability during rapid movement. Sharp teeth (B) are for capturing prey, not speed. Small gills (C) would hinder oxygen intake, which is necessary for sustained activity, so they are unlikely to aid speed. Tough scales (D) provide protection but do not directly contribute to swimming velocity. Among the options, large fins (A) are the most directly related to enhancing swimming speed.

Query 13: It's hard to be the bearer of bad news,but most of IKEA's print and digital fascinating shots of picturesque rooms and products are fake.Those beautiful,"natural-looking" photos of gorgeous rooms and kitchens are mostly the work of computer magic,adjusted and corrected until they're picture-perfect. Martin Enthed,IT manager for IKEA's in-house communications agency,revealed,"In 2012,12 per cent of its product and concept images was CGI-rendered,increasing to 25 per cent in 2013.Since then,that percentage of rendered images appearing in the company's catalogue and online has tripled.75 per cent of the furniture company's product images today are created by computers." It's a move that first caught the attention of photographers and graphic designers a few years back when the furniture giant announced it would cancel photoshoots in favor of computer-generated imagery(CGI). Enthed said IKEA began shifting equipment in 2009 when company officials called in his team and said they weren't pleased with some previous photos and CG images. "So we looked at all the images they said weren't good and the two of three they said were great,and the ones they didn't like were photography and the good ones were all CG,"Enthed said."Now we only talk about a good or bad image - not what technique created it." It's a not-so-secret strategy used by top companies specializing in home and furniture design,though many consumers remain oblivious. The company claims the shift is another way to reduce its environmental footprint,saying constructing digital files produces less waste.It also helps the home furnishing empire's pocketbooks. According to the passage,the advantage of the shift is that IKEA can  _  .
A) expand into another field
B) increase its financial benefits
C) win more support of consumers
D) produce more furniture of high quality

collaborative Response:
The correct answer is B) increase its financial benefits.

The correct answer is B

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The passage discusses IKEA's shift from using photographs to computer-generated imagery (CGI) for their product and concept images. The advantages of this shift are mentioned as reducing environmental waste and saving costs. The passage does not mention any expansion into another field, winning more consumer support, or producing more high-quality furniture. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is B) increase its financial benefits

minister2:
The passage states that the shift to computer-generated imagery (CGI) helps IKEA's pocketbooks, which implies that the company's financial benefits have increased as a result of this change. This is mentioned in the sentence: "It also helps the home furnishing empire's pocketbooks."

My reasoning is as follows:

* The passage mentions that the shift to CGI has helped IKEA's pocketbooks, which suggests a financial advantage.
* Option A, "expand into another field," is not supported by the passage, which only discusses IKEA's use of CGI for product and concept images.
* Option C, "win more support of consumers," is not mentioned in the passage, and it's unlikely that using CGI would directly lead to increased consumer support.
* Option D, "produce more furniture of high quality," is not mentioned in the passage, and the shift to CGI is not related to the quality of furniture.

The correct answer is B

minister3:
The passage explicitly states that IKEA's shift to CGI helps reduce its environmental footprint by minimizing waste from constructing digital files and also benefits its "pocketbooks," indicating financial advantages. While the text mentions the creation of "picture-perfect" images, this refers to the quality of visuals, not the furniture itself. There is no mention of expanding into new fields (A) or gaining consumer support (C). The primary advantages highlighted are environmental and financial.

Query 14: Surprisingly, no one knows how many children receive education in English hospitals, still less the content or quality of that education. Proper records are just not kept. We know that more than 850,000 children go through hospital each year, and that every child of school age has a legal right to continue to receive education while in hospital. We also know there is only one hospital teacher to every 1,000 children in hospital. Little wonder the latest survey concludes that the extent and type of hospital teaching available differ a great deal across the country. It is found that half the hospitals in England which admit children have no teacher. A further quarter have only a part-time teacher. The special children's hospitals in major cities do best; general hospitals in the country and holiday areas are worst off. From this survey, one can estimate that fewer than one in five children have some contact with a hospital teacher--and that contact may be as little as two hours a day. Most children interviewed were surprised to find a teacher in hospital at all. They had not been prepared for it by parents or their own school. If there was a teacher they were much more likely to read books and do math or number work; without a teacher they would only play games. Reasons for hospital teaching range from preventing a child falling behind and maintaining the habit of school to keeping a child occupied, and the latter is often all the teacher can do. The position and influence of many teachers was summed up when parents referred to them as "the library lady" or just "the helper". Children tend to rely on concerned school friends to keep in touch with school work. Several parents spoke of requests for work being ignored or refused by the school. Once back at school children rarely get extra teaching, and are told to catch up as best they can. Many short-stay child-patients catch up quickly. But schools do very little to ease the anxiety about falling behind expressed by many of the children interviewed. The hospital teachers are found  _  .

minister1:
The text describes the situation of hospital teachers in England, highlighting the lack of resources and support they receive. It mentions that many children are surprised to find a teacher in the hospital and that the teachers often have limited influence. The text also notes that the teachers' role is often to keep children occupied rather than to provide substantial educational support. The parents' perception of the teachers as "the library lady" or "the helper" further emphasizes the limited role and influence of the teachers. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is C) not quite helpful

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided in the passage.

The passage describes the situation of hospital teaching in England, highlighting the lack of records, the limited number of hospital teachers, and the varying quality of education provided. It also mentions the limited contact between children and hospital teachers, with most children only having a teacher for a short period of time.

The passage then describes the reasons for hospital teaching, including preventing children from falling behind and maintaining their school habits. However, it also notes that many hospital teachers are not seen as authoritative figures, with children and parents referring to them as "the library lady" or "the helper".

The passage also mentions that children often rely on their school friends to keep up with school work, and that schools do little to ease the anxiety of children who are worried about falling behind.

Based on this information, we can infer that the hospital teachers are not seen as capable or effective in their role.

Query 15: In the traditional marriage, the man worked at a job to earn money for the family. Most men worked in an office, a factory, or some other place away from the home. Since the man earned the money, they paid the bills. The money was used for food, -clothes, the house, and other family needs, the man made most of the decisions. He was the boss. In the traditional marriage, the woman seldom worked away from the house. She stayed at home to care for the children and her husband. She cooked meals, cleaned the house, washed the clothes, and did other housework. Her job at home was very important. In recent years, many couples continues to have a traditional relationship of the kind. The man has a job and earns the money for the family. The woman stays at home and cared for the children and the house. Many Americans are happy with the kind of marriage. But some other Americans have a different impression of marriage and family responsibilities. There are two important differences in male and female roles now. One is that both men and women have many more choices. They may choose to marry or to stay single. They may choose to work or stay at home.  Both men and women may choose roles that are comfortable for them. A second difference in male and female roles is that within marriage many decisions and responsibilities are shared. The husband and wife may choose to have children, or they may not. If they have children, the man takes care of them some of the time, all of the time or not at all. The woman may want to stay at home and take care of the children, or she may vant to go to work. Men and women now decide these things together in a marriage. Many married people now share these decisions and responsibilities of their families. Which of the following is NOT true in the traditional marriage ?
A) Men worked at a job to earn money for the family.
B) The woman made most of decisions.
C) The woman stayed at home to care the children.
D) The man paid the bills.


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: B) The woman made most of decisions.

All answer choices:
1. A) Men worked at a job to earn money for the family.
2. B) The woman made most of decisions.
3. C) The woman stayed at home to care the children.
4. D) The man paid the bills.


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is B.

The correct answer is B

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The passage describes the traditional marriage roles where the man worked to earn money and the woman stayed at home to care for the children and the house. The man made most of the decisions and paid the bills. The woman seldom worked away from the home.

The statement "The woman made most of the decisions" is not true in the traditional marriage as described in the passage. The man was the one who made most of the decisions.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
B) The woman made most of decisions.

minister2:
To determine which statement is NOT true in the traditional marriage, we need to analyze each option based on the description provided.

Option A states that men worked at a job to earn money for the family. This is consistent with the description of the traditional marriage, where the man was the primary breadwinner.

Option B states that the woman made most of the decisions. This is also consistent with the description, as it is stated that the man was the "boss" and made most of the decisions.

Option C states that the woman stayed at home to care for the children. This is also consistent with the description, as it is stated that the woman's job at home was to care for the children and her husband.

Option D states that the man paid the bills. This is consistent with the description, as it is stated that the man earned the money and paid the bills.

However, the description also states that "many couples continue to have a traditional relationship of the kind" and that "many Americans are happy with the kind of marriage", implying that not all couples have a traditional marriage. This suggests that the statement is not universally true, but it is not explicitly stated that it is not true in the traditional marriage.

However, upon closer examination, it can be inferred that the correct answer is B) The woman made most of decisions. The passage states that the man made most of the decisions, not the woman.

The correct answer is B

minister3:
The passage describes traditional marriages where the man typically worked outside the home to earn money, paid the bills, and made most of the decisions. It also states that the woman stayed at home to care for children and handle household duties. Option B claims the woman made most of the decisions, which directly contradicts the text's assertion that the man held this role. The other options (A, C, D) align with the described roles in traditional marriages. 

The correct answer is B

Query 16: A rich American went into a shop in London. He wanted very much to buy a nice looking watch, but the owner of the shop asked five hundred dollars for it. Suddenly a young man came into the shop, took the watch out of the owner's hands and ran out with it. It all happened in a few seconds. When the owner ran out into the street, the young man was already lost among the people. The American went on. At the next corner, he saw the young man with the watch in his hand. "Do you want to buy a fine watch, sir?" he asked in a low voice. "It's only a hundred dollars." "The young man doesn't know I saw him stealing the watch," he thought. The American paid at once and went back to his room with the watch. He told his friend about the fine watch. His friend took a look at the watch and started laughing. He said, "You are a fool. This watch isn't worth even ten dollars. I'm sure the shop owner and the young man planned this together." The American paid    _    dollars for the watch.

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The American paid 100 dollars for the watch.

The American initially saw the watch being stolen and then saw the young man trying to sell it to him at a much lower price. The American paid 100 dollars for the watch, which is the amount the young man asked for it. The final price paid by the American is not affected by the fact that the shop owner and the young man might have planned the theft together.

The correct answer is C.

minister2:
To solve this question, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The American initially saw the young man steal the watch from the shop owner for $500.
2. The young man then sold the watch to the American for $100.
3. The friend of the American, upon seeing the watch, laughed and said it was only worth $10.
4. This implies that the watch's value decreased significantly from $500 to $10.

Given this information, we can infer that the American paid $100 for the watch, which is a significant reduction from the original price of $500. However, the friend's statement that the watch is worth only $10 suggests that the American overpaid by a large margin.

The correct answer is C

minister3:
The correct answer is C

president:
The American paid $100 for the watch.

Query 18: Finding true happiness is a universal aspiration  . We all want it, but can we all have it? Genuine happiness is written all over our faces when we are truly contented, and, likewise, a forced smile does nothing to hide underlying sadness. Believing that everyone can create their own lasting joy, Matthieu Richard has been declared the Happiest Man in the World. Richard earned his "happiest man" status after a series of laboratory tests in 2004. Richard has shared his thoughts on happiness with a worldwide audience. As an experienced speaker, he has explained his insights into happiness to everyone, from students to corporate groups. Looking inwards to find joy rather than relying on outer conditions, he believes, is the way to achieve well-being. "It's quite clear that the outer conditions are not enough. The way we interpret those outer conditions in our inner experience is what determines either a sense of well-being or misery. We love to go jogging for fitness and we do all kinds of things to remain beautiful, yet we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most: the way our minds function. It's the essential thing that determines the quality of our experience." Besides this, Richard stresses that it is not what's happening around us that makes us unhappy, but rather the way we choose to react to it. The pursuit of happiness is becoming a modern obsession . As life becomes more complex, our ability to process our reactions to various outside influences comes under strain. "Genuine happiness" he says, "doesn't mean pleasant feelings one after the other. It's more like a series of qualities that we can develop as skills -- like openness, genuine love, compassion, inner strength and inner peace." How can we pursuit happiness?
A) Go jogging for happiness.
B) Do everything to remain beautiful.
C) Make sure that our minds are functioning normally.
D) Develop necessary qualities.


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: D) Develop necessary qualities.

1. A) Go jogging for happiness.
2. B) Do everything to remain beautiful.

The correct answer is D

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the passage and the options provided:

1. The passage discusses Matthieu Richard's views on happiness, emphasizing the importance of inner conditions and how we interpret outer conditions.
2. Richard states that the way our minds function is the most important factor in determining our well-being.
3. He also mentions that genuine happiness is not about pleasant feelings but about developing specific qualities.

Given this context, the correct answer is:

D) Develop necessary qualities.

This option aligns with Richard's explanation that genuine happiness is about developing qualities such as openness, genuine love, compassion, inner strength, and inner peace. The other options (A, B, and C) do not directly relate to the core message of the passage.

The correct answer is D.

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the options and the text provided.

The text emphasizes the importance of inner well-being and the development of qualities such as openness, genuine love, compassion, inner strength, and inner peace. It suggests that true happiness comes from within and is not solely dependent on external factors.

Option A, "Go jogging for happiness," is mentioned in the text as an example of an activity people do for fitness, but it is not presented as a means to achieve happiness.

Option B, "Do everything to remain beautiful," is also mentioned in the text as an example of an activity people do to maintain their physical appearance, but it is not presented as a means to achieve happiness.

Option C, "Make sure that our minds are functioning normally," is mentioned in the text as an important aspect of well-being, but it is not presented as the primary way to pursue happiness.

Option D, "Develop necessary qualities," aligns with the text's emphasis on developing qualities such as openness, genuine love, compassion, inner strength, and inner peace as a means to achieve happiness.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The passage emphasizes that genuine happiness is not dependent on external conditions but on internal qualities such as openness, genuine love, compassion, inner strength, and inner peace. Matthieu Richard argues that these qualities should be developed as skills, rather than focusing on superficial activities like jogging for fitness or remaining beautiful. While options A and B are mentioned as common pursuits, they are contrasted with the idea that true happiness requires attention to mental well-being and inner growth. Option C is partially relevant but is framed as something people neglect, whereas the core message centers on cultivating specific qualities.

Query 20: Ding-Dong! "Jason, honey? Can you answer the door?" "I am busy, mom!" Jason shouted back at his mother. He had spent three hours so far working to this point in the game. He couldn't stop now. Ding-Dong!Mom's footsteps approached the front door. "Jason, it's your friend Todd." Mom called from the doorway. Todd, his best friend, stepped into the room. " Jason!I need a partner for playing basketball. "He sounded excited. Jason snorted. "No way, Todd. I'm playing a game here." Jason gave his friend a dirty look, and his character in the game almost got killed while he looked away, " I almost died because of you!" Todd looked at Jason's mother. Jason's mother looked back at him. They both looked at Jason. "Why don't you play basketball with your friend?" Jason's mother suggested. "Tomorrow, maybe..." There were more levels to beat tomorrow, though, Maybe he had played tomorrow. He'd have to see what mood he was in. He thought he heard footsteps walking away, but he was too busy beating the next level to care. An hour later, Jason's father came home. It was dinner time after his father washed up and sat down. Jason didn't even hear his name being called to the table. He didn't hear his father walk at behind him and ask him to turn the game off, either. When the screen suddenly went black and his father's angry face loomed in front of him, Jason finally heard. "No more game for a month." Jason's father shouted at him. "You don't play basketball, you don't come to dinner, and you don't do your chores. We'll make you do something else before you play any more." Jason nodded slowly. He knew better than to argue with his father, and when he thought about it, he had been playing quite a bit. It was fun, but he was letting down his friends, his family, and himself by paying too much. He'd try harder in the future. Which of the following is the best title of this passage?
A) Inside the game
B) Games or Supper.
C) Jason's Angry Father
D) Use of the Computer.

2. B) Games or Supper.
3. C) Jason's Angry Father
4. D) Use of the Computer.


collaborative Response:
The best title for the passage is "Games or Supper" because it encapsulates the central conflict between Jason's gaming habit and his family responsibilities, such as family dinner. This title effectively highlights the trade-off Jason faces, making it the most fitting choice.

The correct answer is B) Games or Supper.

The correct answer is B.

The correct answer is B

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The passage describes a situation where Jason is engrossed in a video game and his father intervenes, leading to a consequence for Jason's gaming habits. The title should reflect the main conflict or theme of the passage, which is the tension between Jason's gaming and his responsibilities. The best title that captures this is:

"The correct answer is B) Games or Supper."

minister2:
To determine the best title of the passage, let's analyze the content and main themes presented.

The passage revolves around Jason's behavior and his relationship with his family, particularly his father. The story highlights Jason's excessive gaming habits, his neglect of his responsibilities, and the consequences he faces as a result. The main conflict arises from Jason's prioritization of gaming over other aspects of his life, including spending time with his friend, participating in family activities, and completing his chores.

Option A, "Inside the Game," is a possible title, but it doesn't accurately capture the broader themes of the passage. The story is not primarily about the game itself, but rather about Jason's actions and consequences outside of the game.

Option B, "Games or Supper," is a good choice because it reflects the central conflict of the passage, which is Jason's choice between playing games and participating in family activities, such as dinner. However, it doesn't fully encompass the other themes and consequences presented.

Option C, "Jason's Angry Father," is a possible title, but it's not the best choice because the passage is not primarily about Jason's father's anger, but rather about Jason's behavior and its consequences.

Option D, "Use of the Computer," is a good choice because it highlights the central issue of Jason's excessive gaming and its impact on his life. However, it's a bit too specific and doesn't fully capture the broader themes of the passage.

Considering the main themes and conflicts presented in the passage, the best title is "Games or Supper" because it accurately reflects the central conflict and Jason's dilemma.

The correct answer is B

minister3:
The passage revolves around Jason's conflict between his gaming obsession and his responsibilities to his family and friends. While his father's anger is a significant event, the central theme is the prioritization of games over family time and obligations. The title should reflect this tension. Option B, "Games or Supper," directly addresses the core conflict of choosing between gaming and family activities, which is a recurring element in the story. Other options either focus too narrowly on specific details (e.g., "Use of the Computer," "Jason's Angry Father") or are overly vague ("Inside the game").

Query 21: Country music is one of the most popular kinds of music in the United States today because it is about simple but strong human feelings and events-love, sadness, good times, and bad times. It tells real-life, stories and sounds the way people really talk. As life becomes more complicated , it is good to hear music about ordinary people. Country music, sometimes called country-western, comes from two kinds of music. One is the traditional music of the people in the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern Unite States. The other is traditional cowboy music from the west. The singers usually play guitars, and in the 1920s they started using electric guitars. At first city people said country music was low class. It was popular mostly in the South. But during World War II, thousands of Southerners went to the Northeast and Midwest to work in the factories. They took their music with them. Soldiers from the rest of the country went to army camps in the South. They learned country music. Slowly it became popular all over the country. Today country music is also popular everywhere in the United States and Canada--in small towns and in New York City, among black and white, and among educated and uneducated people. About 1, 200 radio stations broadcast country music twenty-four hours a day. English stars sing it in British English, and people in other countries sing it in their own languages. The music that started with cowboys and poor southerners is now popular all over the world. It can be learned from the passage that country music comes from_.

To determine where country music comes from, we need to analyze the passage carefully. The passage states that country music comes from two kinds of music: traditional music of the people in the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States and traditional cowboy music from the west. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is D) the Appalachian Mountains and the West

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the passage and the options provided.

The passage explains that country music originated from two kinds of music: the traditional music of the people in the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States and the traditional cowboy music from the West. This information directly supports option D, as it mentions both the Appalachian Mountains and the West as the sources of country music.

Option A, the Northeast and Midwest, is mentioned in the passage as places where Southerners went to work in factories and soldiers went to army camps, but it is not stated that these regions are the origins of country music. Option B, factories and army camps in the South, is also not the origin of country music, but rather a way in which it spread throughout the country. Option C, real-life stories in small towns, is a characteristic of country music, but it is not the origin of the music.

Therefore, the correct answer is the one that directly states the origins of country music.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The passage explicitly states that country music comes from two sources: the traditional music of the people in the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States and traditional cowboy music from the west.

Query 23: The car was invented just a century ago. You may know all kinds of cars' names, but many people don't know who was the inventor of the first car. The first car was invented not by an Englishman, but by an American. His name was Henry Ford. Henry was born in a poor family, He was the eldest of the six children. When he was a boy, he became interested in watches and machines. When he was twelve years old, his mother died. Soon he had to work in a machine shop for two dollars and fifty cents a week. In the evenings, he repaired watches for another hour for another dollar a week. The hard life made him strong and able. At that time, there was another interest in the life of the young boy. He hoped to make a machine. It could run without horses. He overcame a lot of difficulties and in April, 1893, the "horseless carriage" was invented at last. It was the first car. Later, Henry Ford set up the Ford Motor Company. He was the really first inventor of car in the world. Henry had to work hard in the shop because   _  .

collaborative Response:
The correct answer is D) he had to support his family.

The correct answer is D

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The text states that Henry Ford had to work hard in the shop because he had to support his family. This is explicitly mentioned in the sentence: "Soon he had to work in a machine shop for two dollars and fifty cents a week. In the evenings, he repaired watches for another hour for another dollar a week." This indicates that he was working to support his family financially.

The correct answer is D.

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the text and options carefully.

The text describes Henry Ford's early life, his interests, and his struggles. It mentions that he had to work in a machine shop for two dollars and fifty cents a week, and in the evenings, he repaired watches for another dollar a week. This indicates that Henry Ford had to work hard to support his family.

Now, let's examine the options:

A) he wanted to open a company of his own: This is not mentioned in the text as a reason for Henry Ford's hard work.

B) his mother was ill and needed treatment: The text states that Henry's mother died when he was twelve years old, so this option is not relevant.

C) his father used to drink a lot: There is no mention of Henry's father's drinking habits in the text.

D) he had to support his family: This option is consistent with the text, which states that Henry Ford had to work in a machine shop and repair watches in the evenings to earn money.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The passage states that Henry Ford was born into a poor family and became the eldest of six children. After his mother's death at age twelve, he was forced to work in a machine shop for a low wage. This financial necessity, combined with the family's poverty, explains why he had to work hard. While the text mentions his mother's death and his interest in inventing, it does not provide evidence that his father's drinking (option C) or his mother's illness (option B) directly caused his need to work. Option A refers to his later goal of opening a company, which is unrelated to the immediate reason for his hard work as a boy. The correct answer is D) he had to support his family.

minister1:
The passage describes a Robotics merit badge class where Scouts learn about robots, build robots, and program them. The key points are:

- Scouts learn about the uses of robots in medicine and industry.
- Scouts are divided into teams to build robots.
- Each team builds a basic robot and programs it.
- The robots are not used in industry but are built for a competition.

Given these points, the correct answer is:

A) Scouts learned about different uses for robots

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided in the passage.

The passage describes the Robotics merit badge class at the 2011 Advance Camp in Antioch, Calif. It explains that the class is taught by counselors and that Scouts can choose to earn this merit badge. The passage then describes the activities that took place in the class, including a talk by one of the counselors about the many different uses for robots.

Option A states that Scouts learned about different uses for robots. This is consistent with the information provided in the passage, which states that "First, one of the counselors talked to Matthew and the other Scouts in his Robotic class about the many different uses for robots."

Option B states that every Scout had to build a robot by themselves. However, the passage states that the Scouts were divided into five-person teams, and each team was required to build a basic robot. This suggests that the Scouts worked in teams, not individually.

Option C states that the robots Scouts built will be used in industry. While the passage mentions that robots are used in industry, it does not suggest that the specific robots built by the Scouts will be used in industry.

Option D states that the robots Scouts built were of the same height. However, the passage states that the robots were 8-inch-tall machines, but it does not suggest that they were all the same height.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is the one that accurately describes the activities that took place in the Robotics merit badge class.

The correct answer is A

minister3:
The passage describes an event at the Advance Camp where Scouts participated in a Robotics merit badge class. It explicitly mentions that a counselor gave a talk about the many different uses for robots, including medicine and industry. This directly supports option A. The text also states that Scouts were divided into teams to build robots, contradicting option B (which implies individual work). There is no specific mention that the robots built were intended for industrial use (option C) or that all robots were the same height (option D).

All answer choices:
1. A) in a bank
2. B) on the internet
3. C) above our heads
4. D) in cloudless skies


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is C.

The correct answer is C

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The question is asking about the typical location of clouds. Let's analyze the options:

A) "in a bank" - This option is not related to the location of clouds. Banks are financial institutions.

B) "on the internet" - This option is also not related to the location of clouds. The internet is a global network of computers.

C) "above our heads" - This is the correct answer. Clouds are typically found in the sky, above our heads.

D) "in cloudless skies" - This option is incorrect because it describes a sky without clouds, not the location of clouds.

The correct answer is C) above our heads.

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the phrase "Clouds flit and flow" and the options provided.

The phrase "Clouds flit and flow" suggests movement and changeability, which is characteristic of clouds in the atmosphere. The word "flit" implies a quick and light movement, while "flow" suggests a smooth and continuous movement.

Option A, "in a bank," is not a suitable location for clouds, as banks are financial institutions or physical structures, and clouds do not reside within them.

Option B, "on the internet," is also not a suitable location for clouds, as the internet is a network of interconnected computers and servers, and clouds are not digital entities.

Option D, "in cloudless skies," is a contradictory phrase, as clouds are typically present in the sky, and the term "cloudless" implies the absence of clouds.

Option C, "above our heads," is the most suitable location for clouds, as they are formed in the atmosphere and can be seen floating above the Earth's surface.

The correct answer is C

minister3:
The sentence "Clouds flit and flow" describes the movement of clouds in the sky. Clouds are naturally found in the atmosphere, which is above the Earth. Option A ("in a bank") is unrelated to the physical location of clouds. Option B ("on the internet") refers to a metaphorical use of "cloud" (as in cloud computing), which is not the literal context here. Option D ("in cloudless skies") contradicts the presence of clouds. The most accurate and literal completion is "above our heads," which aligns with the common understanding of where clouds exist.

1. A) a large asteroid impact
2. B) regional drought
3. C) new glacier formation
4. D) a decrease in the growth of weeds


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is A.

The correct answer is A

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
To determine which event would most likely cause a rapid extinction of organisms, we need to consider the impact each event would have on the environment and the organisms living in it.

A) **A large asteroid impact**: This event would cause immediate and catastrophic damage. The impact would release a tremendous amount of energy, causing widespread destruction and creating a global dust cloud that would block out sunlight, leading to a rapid drop in temperature and a collapse of ecosystems. This is known as an impact winter, which can cause mass extinction.

B) **Regional drought**: While droughts can be severe and cause local extinctions, they typically affect a specific region and do not cause a global extinction event. Organisms in other regions would likely remain unaffected.

C) **New glacier formation**: Glaciers form over long periods and do not cause rapid extinctions. They may cause local extinctions in areas where they form, but this is not a global event.

D) **A decrease in the growth of weeds**: This event would not cause a rapid extinction of organisms. Weeds are generally considered pests and their decrease would not significantly impact the overall ecosystem.

**The correct answer is A**

minister2:
To determine which event would most likely cause a rapid extinction of organisms, let's analyze each option:

A) A large asteroid impact: This event would have a significant and immediate impact on the environment. The impact would release massive amounts of energy, causing widespread destruction, including massive earthquakes, tsunamis, and fires. The impact would also throw up a large amount of debris into the atmosphere, potentially blocking out sunlight and affecting photosynthesis, which is essential for plant growth. This would lead to a rapid decline in food sources and habitats for many organisms, making it difficult for them to survive.

B) Regional drought: While a regional drought could have a significant impact on local ecosystems, it would likely be a more gradual process. Organisms would have time to adapt or migrate to areas with more water, and some species might even benefit from the drought.

C) New glacier formation: Glaciers can have a significant impact on ecosystems, but the process would be slower and more gradual. As glaciers advance, they would cover and alter habitats, potentially leading to the extinction of some species. However, this process would take thousands of years, giving organisms time to adapt.

D) A decrease in the growth of weeds: Weeds are often considered invasive species, but their decline would likely have a minimal impact on the overall ecosystem. Many organisms rely on weeds as a food source or habitat, and their decline would not lead to a rapid extinction of organisms.

Considering the potential impact of each event, the large asteroid impact would have the most significant and immediate effect on the environment, leading to a rapid extinction of organisms.

The correct answer is A

minister3:
A large asteroid impact would cause immediate and widespread environmental devastation, such as massive wildfires, tsunamis, and a dramatic cooling effect from dust in the atmosphere, leading to the collapse of ecosystems and rapid extinction of many species. Regional droughts (B) and new glacier formation (C) typically have more localized or gradual effects, while a decrease in weed growth (D) is a minor ecological change unlikely to trigger rapid extinction. The correct answer is A.

Query 28: A long time ago people thought that the sun went round the earth. In some countries people even said that the sun was a god  . They thought the god drove across the sky each day on a golden horse. Now we know the earth goes round the sun. It takes the earth a year to go all way round the sun. Today men even know how far it is for the earth to go round the sun. They tell us that the earth travels over a thousand miles a minute on its journey round the sun. The sun is really a star. It is much bigger than the earth and it is very hot. Some people have been to the moon but we know that no one can ever go to the sun. It is far too hot for people to live anywhere near it. The sun is three hundred thousand times heavier than the earth and more than million times larger. The earth travels over   _   miles an hour.

The Earth's orbital speed around the sun is approximately 67,000 miles per hour. This speed is derived from the Earth's annual orbit of about 584 million miles. Dividing the distance by the time (365.25 days) gives an average speed of approximately 1,600,000 miles per day, which converts to roughly 66,667 miles per hour. While the original text states 60,000 miles per hour, the most accurate figure is 67,000 mph. However, adhering strictly to the information provided in the passage, the correct answer is D) 60,000 miles per hour, as per the text's data, but the actual speed is slightly higher. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The question asks for the distance the Earth travels in miles per hour on its journey around the sun. The text states that the Earth travels over a thousand miles a minute on its journey around the sun.

To find the distance in miles per hour, we need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

1,000 miles per minute * 60 minutes per hour = 60,000 miles per hour

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is D

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided in the passage.

The passage states that the earth travels over a thousand miles a minute on its journey round the sun. To find the distance traveled per hour, we need to multiply the distance traveled per minute by the number of minutes in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour.

So, if the earth travels over a thousand miles a minute, it would travel:

1,000 miles/minute x 60 minutes/hour = 60,000 miles/hour

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The passage states that the Earth travels "over a thousand miles a minute" on its journey around the sun. To convert this to miles per hour, multiply by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour):  
1,000 miles/minute × 60 minutes/hour = 60,000 miles/hour.  

Among the options, D) 60,000 matches this calculation. The other choices either do not align with the given data or are inconsistent with the scale of the Earth's orbital speed.

Query 30: My grandfather spent most of his life in a turbulent   India. After settling in New York, he took up his true passion: gardening. Grandfather's garden was where I took refuge   from a world of adults and schoolwork. My grandfather cultivated squash   and tomatoes -- it was not rare to find me somewhere in the garden, either secretly eating a tomato, or just sitting and admiring my grandfather's hard work. However, as time went by, I did not have the chance to visit his house as often as I used to. On my eleventh birthday, I received a gift bag wrapped in pretty paper from my grandfather. Excited to see what he had given to me for my birthday, I tore apart the paper only to find a yellow squash. I was very angry. What a stupid present! But gradually, I realized that in my developing a relationship with his garden, I had unknowingly grown very close to my grandfather himself, something he wished to remind me of through his gift. His commitment towards doing things definitely influenced me. It could bring him a sense of accomplishment. Because of him, I try to model the idea of approaching everything with both drive and passion. My grandfather passed away five years ago, but his influence on me could not be bigger than it is today. As I prepare to enter college and move on from my relatively sheltered high school life toward achieving complete independence, allowing my passions to find their way into whatever I may be doing will be very necessary. I still look up to my grandfather very much to this day, and I hope that one day I will be able to sow in my own garden, and give someone else a squash on his or her birthday -- it was the most meaningful gift I have ever received.[:ZXXK] Why did the grandfather send the author a squash?

The grandfather sent the author a squash to remind the author of the close relationship they had developed through their shared passion for gardening. The author's grandfather had a strong commitment to his work in the garden, and this gift was a way for him to express his influence on the author's life. The author later realized that the squash was a meaningful gift that symbolized their bond and the lessons he had learned from his grandfather.

The correct answer is C.

minister2:
To determine why the grandfather sent the author a squash, let's analyze the information provided in the passage.

The passage states that the author spent a lot of time in the grandfather's garden, where they would often admire the grandfather's hard work and secretly eat tomatoes. This suggests a close relationship between the author and the grandfather, with the garden serving as a common ground.

When the author receives the squash as a gift, they initially react negatively, but later come to realize that the gift was meant to remind them of their close relationship with the grandfather. The passage explicitly states that the grandfather "wished to remind me of through his gift" that they had grown close through their shared experiences in the garden.

This information directly supports option C) He wanted to remind the author that they had been close. This option accurately reflects the grandfather's intention behind sending the squash as a gift.

The other options do not accurately reflect the grandfather's intention. Option A) Squash was the author's favorite vegetable is not mentioned in the passage, and there is no indication that the grandfather knew this. Option B) Squash was the greatest achievement of him is not relevant to the context of the gift, and option D) He wanted the author to follow his career is not supported by the passage.

The correct answer is C

minister3:
The correct answer is C. The passage explains that the grandfather's gift of a squash was intended to remind the author of their close relationship, which developed through shared time in the garden. While the squash symbolizes his cultivation efforts, the key detail is the author's realization that the gift highlighted their bond, not the vegetable's personal significance or a career directive. The grandfather's intention was to reinforce the emotional connection rather than focus on the squash as a standalone item or achievement. 

The correct answer is C

president:
The correct answer is C) He wanted to remind the author that they had been close.

Query 32: While reading a book in English, every few lines of text, you run across a word or two that you don't know. You look up every new word in the dictionary. Bad move. All that does slow you down. Even electric or CD -ROM dictionaries can get in the way of your reading progress. A dictionary is like a road map. It can help you if you get lost and point you in the right direction. But if you stop to look at the "map" each time you take a step, you'll get nowhere fast. On your English learning "journey", a dictionary can be a helpful "travel companion "--if it is not overused. To help you start thinking in English, use an English-to-English dictionary. Otherwise, you will always depend on your native language and end up translating in your head. A good dictionary can help you do more than just find the meaning of a word. It can help you verify  spelling, check word forms and grammar usage, find example sentence and learn pronunciation. Some dictionaries even provide exercises to teach you how to use their resources. Take time to get to know your dictionary. Learn the pronunciation symbols. Understand what the abbreviations   mean. Try to master the important grammar rules. Look for charts, diagrams and lists might be useful in the future. You will discover how helpful it can be to make friends with your dictionary. And as they say, "A friend in need is a friend indeed." Why do we need a good English-to-English dictionary?
A) Because it is a good friend.
B) Because it can help us to find the right direction if we get lost.
C) Without it we'll always depend on our native language and end up translating in our head.
D) Because it can help us to start thinking in English and in Chinese.

Query 33: Language has a powerful influence over people and their behaviour. This is especially true in the fields of advertising. Visual content and design in advertising have a very great impact on the consumers,but it is language that helps people to identify a product and keep it in mind. The choice of language to show specific messages with the intention of influencing people is of vital importance. The English language is known for its extensive vocabulary. While many other languages have only one or two words to carry a particular meaning,English may have five or six. Moreover,the meanings of these five or six words may differ very slightly and in a very subtle  way. It is important to understand the connotation  of a word. "Armchair",for example,suggests comfort,whereas "chair" causes no particular feelings. Different people sometimes interpret language in different ways. Both the mass media,when reporting news items,and marketing and advertising personnel have to consider the emotive power of the words they use. First,they make a decision about what to communicate and what to withhold .One way in which advertisers adapt language to their own use is to take compound words and use them as adjectives. Examples of these compounds are:top-quality,economysize,chocolateflavoured,featherlight and longerlasting. These compounds have become part of the English language. The language of advertising always emphasizes  why one product stands out in comparison with the others. Don't expect advertising language to be always correct in the normal sense. For example,comparatives are often used when no real comparison is made. An advertisement for a detergent  may say "It gets clothes whiter",but whiter than what? When choosing words for their products,advertisers should consider  _  .
A) whether the words are easy to remember
B) what emotion the words can bring to people
C) whether the words are popular and in fashion
D) which group of people will be interested in them

The passage highlights the importance of language in advertising, emphasizing the need to consider the emotive power of words and the connotation of specific words. It also mentions the use of compound words and the tendency to use comparatives without a real comparison.

The correct consideration for advertisers when choosing words for their products is to consider the emotion the words can bring to people. This is because the primary goal of advertising is to influence people's behavior and purchasing decisions, and language plays a crucial role in achieving this goal.

The passage explicitly states that both the mass media and marketing and advertising personnel have to consider the emotive power of the words they use. It also provides examples of how advertisers adapt language to their own use, such as using compound words to create specific connotations.

The passage emphasizes the importance of language in advertising, particularly its ability to convey specific messages and influence consumer behavior. It highlights the role of **connotation** and **emotive power** of words, such as how "armchair" suggests comfort while "chair" does not. Additionally, it mentions that advertisers use compound words to shape perceptions and that the language often prioritizes emotional impact over literal accuracy (e.g., "whiter" without a comparison). While memory and target group interest are mentioned indirectly, the core focus is on the **emotive effect** of language. The correct answer is B.

Query 35: Paul and Daniel entered into a contract in writing on November 1, the essential part of which read as follows: "Paul to supply Daniel with 200 personalized Christmas cards bearing a photograph of Daniel and his family on or before December 15, 1970, and Daniel to pay $100 30 days thereafter. Photograph to be taken by Paul at Daniel's house. Cards guaranteed to be fully satisfactory and on time." Because Daniel suddenly became ill, Paul was unable to take the necessary photograph of Daniel and his family until the first week of December. The final week's delay was caused by Paul's not being notified promptly by Daniel of his recovery. Before taking the photograph of Daniel and his family, Paul advised Daniel that he was likely to be delayed a day or two beyond December 15 in making delivery because of the time required to process the photograph and cards. Daniel told Paul to take the photograph anyway. The cards were finally delivered by Paul to Daniel on December 17, Paul having diligently worked on them in the interim. Although the cards pleased the rest of the family, Daniel refused to accept them because, as he said, squinting at one of the cards at arm's length without bothering to put on his reading glasses, "The photograph makes me look too old. Besides, the cards weren't delivered on time.""In an action by Paul against Daniel, which of the following would be Daniel's best defense?
A) The cards, objectively viewed, were not satisfactory. 
B) The cards, subjectively viewed, were not satisfactory. 
C) The cards were not delivered on time.

4. D) Daniel's illness excused him from further obligation under the contract


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is C

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
To determine Daniel's best defense, we need to analyze the contract and the circumstances surrounding the delivery of the cards.

1. **Contract Analysis**:
   - The contract specifies that Paul must deliver 200 personalized Christmas cards with a photograph of Daniel and his family on or before December 15, 1970.
   - Daniel must pay $100 30 days after delivery.
   - The cards are guaranteed to be fully satisfactory and on time.

2. **Circumstances**:
   - Paul was unable to take the photograph until the first week of December due to Daniel's illness.
   - Paul advised Daniel of the likely delay but Daniel told Paul to take the photograph anyway.
   - The cards were delivered on December 17, which is two days late.

3. **Daniel's Defense**:
   - **Option A**: The cards, objectively viewed, were not satisfactory. This defense is not applicable because the contract does not specify that the cards must be objectively satisfactory; it only guarantees that they will be fully satisfactory.
   - **Option B**: The cards, subjectively viewed, were not satisfactory. This defense is not applicable because the contract does not specify that the cards must be subjectively satisfactory; it only guarantees that they will be fully satisfactory.
   - **Option C**: The cards were not delivered on time. This defense is applicable because the contract specifies that the cards must be delivered on or before December 15, and they were delivered on December 17.
   - **Option D**: Daniel's illness excused him from further obligation under the contract. This defense is not applicable because the contract does not provide an excuse for Daniel's illness.

**Conclusion**: The correct answer is C) The cards were not delivered on time.

minister2:
To determine Daniel's best defense, let's analyze the situation:

1. The contract specified that the cards were to be delivered on or before December 15, 1970. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, including Daniel's illness and the time required to process the photograph and cards, the delivery was delayed until December 17. This delay was not entirely Paul's fault, as Daniel's illness and the time required to process the photograph and cards contributed to the delay.

2. The contract also specified that the cards were to be "fully satisfactory." However, Daniel's subjective opinion of the photograph on the cards is that it makes him look "too old." This is a subjective view, and the contract does not specify that the cards must meet Daniel's subjective standards of satisfaction.

3. The contract did not specify that Daniel's illness would excuse him from further obligation under the contract. In fact, the contract was entered into before Daniel became ill, and his illness does not appear to have been a material factor in the delay.

Considering these points, the best defense for Daniel would be that the cards, subjectively viewed, were not satisfactory. This is because the contract did not specify that the cards must meet Daniel's subjective standards of satisfaction, and Daniel's subjective opinion of the photograph on the cards is that it makes him look "too old."

To determine when you can make a tour of the Chapel, we need to analyze the information provided in the text.

The text states that the Chapel is "open from 10:00 to 17:00, Mon to Sun" and also mentions that "Chapel opens at 12:00 on Sun following service". This implies that the Chapel is open at 12:00 on Sundays after the service, but it does not explicitly state that this is a tour time.

However, it does not provide any information about specific tour times for the Chapel. Therefore, we can conclude that the Chapel is open for general visitation, but we cannot determine the specific times for a tour.

However, the question asks when you can make a tour of the Chapel, which implies a specific guided tour. Since the text does not provide any information about guided tours, we can infer that the Chapel is open for general visitation, but there is no information about when a tour might be available.

Given the options are not provided, I will assume the question is asking when the Chapel is open for general visitation. Based on the information provided, the Chapel is open from 10:00 to 17:00, Monday to Saturday, and at 12:00 on Sundays following the service.

A bigger part of the story is on the demand side.From the day the television remote control was invented,people around the world have searched for new ways to be lazy.Take into consideration that more and more people can afford robots, and the time secms ripe to introduce robots to the ordinary family.     To be sure,robots that walk on two legs and talk like people are still a long way off.However, robots that do basic housework such as cleaning or gardening are sure to come out soon.One thing is certain--when these robots do come into our homes,it will change things forever.

The correct answer is D

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The question asks for the true statement regarding the development and future of robots in homes. Let's analyze the options:

A) Robots have already come into ordinary homes.
- This statement is not entirely accurate. While there are robots like Roomba that have entered some homes, they are not yet common in all ordinary homes.

B) Technology is the only basis of the development of robots.
- This statement is too narrow. While technology is a significant factor, the demand from consumers also plays a crucial role in the development of robots.

C) Sony and General Electric are not interested in designing small robots.
- This statement is false. The text explicitly mentions that companies like Sony and General Electric are working on designs for small robots.

D) Robots that can walk on two legs and talk like people are still far from us.
- This statement is true. The text explicitly states that robots that walk on two legs and talk like people are still a long way off.

The correct answer is D) Robots that can walk on two legs and talk like people are still far from us.

minister2:
Let's analyze the question and options carefully.

The passage discusses the development of robots and their potential to move into ordinary homes, performing tasks such as cleaning and gardening. It highlights the advancements in technology, including devices that can recognize and respond to human voice, and the various ways robots can move around. The passage also mentions the demand side, stating that people have been seeking new ways to be lazy, and that more people can afford robots, making it a good time to introduce them to ordinary families.

Now, let's examine the options:

A) Robots have already come into ordinary homes. - This statement is not supported by the passage. The passage suggests that robots are on the verge of entering ordinary homes, but it does not claim that they have already done so.

B) Technology is the only basis of the development of robots. - This statement is not entirely accurate. The passage mentions that technology is a significant factor in the development of robots, but it also highlights the demand side, stating that people's desire for convenience and laziness is driving the development of robots.

C) Sony and General Electric are not interested in designing small robots. - This statement is directly contradicted by the passage, which mentions that companies including Sony and General Electric are working on designs for small robots.

D) Robots that can walk on two legs and talk like people are still far from us. - This statement is consistent with the passage, which suggests that while robots that can walk on two legs and talk like people are still in the future, robots that can perform basic housework such as cleaning or gardening are likely to be introduced soon.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The passage states that robots capable of walking on two legs and talking like humans are "still a long way off," which directly supports option D. While it mentions technology and demand as factors driving robot development, it clearly differentiates that these advanced humanoid robots are not yet a reality. Options A and B are contradicted by the text, as it indicates robots are "going to" enter homes and highlights demand as a significant factor alongside technology. Option C is false because the passage explicitly names Sony and General Electric as companies working on small robot designs. 

The correct answer is D

The passage provides tips for getting a good night's sleep, including exercising, avoiding certain activities and substances before bedtime, and engaging in relaxing activities before sleep. It also mentions that drinking a cup of warm milk may help with sleep.

The question asks what will NOT help you to sleep well just before bedtime. Based on the passage, we can eliminate options that are mentioned as helpful for sleep.

Option A, listening to quiet music, is mentioned as a helpful activity before bedtime. Option B, having a warm bath, is also mentioned as a helpful activity. Option C, drinking some warm milk, is mentioned as a helpful activity.

Option D, playing football, is mentioned as a good way to exercise, but it is specifically stated that these activities should not be done just before bedtime. This is the only option that is mentioned as potentially disrupting sleep.

The correct answer is D

The correct answer is C) if you read as a hobby.

The correct answer is C

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The passage discusses the benefits of reading as a hobby, including that it is fun, convenient, and useful. It also mentions that reading can improve one's computer skills and potentially lead to writing. The question asks when you can read faster, which is a result of improving your reading skills. The passage states that as your reading skills improve, you will read faster. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is C) if you read as a hobby

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the text and options carefully.

The text states that reading is a good hobby for several reasons, including that it is fun, useful, and can be done anywhere. It also mentions that as your reading skills improve, you will probably find your schoolwork becomes much better.

Now, let's examine the options:

A) after you read a book - This option is not directly related to the text, which discusses the benefits of reading as a hobby, not the consequences of reading a specific book.

B) after you finish your schoolwork - This option is not supported by the text, which mentions that schoolwork may become better as a result of improving reading skills, but does not imply that reading is a consequence of finishing schoolwork.

C) if you read as a hobby - This option aligns with the text, which states that "If you read as a hobby, you will get better and better at it. And you will read faster and find it easier to understand what you read."

D) if you are a student - This option is not directly related to the text, which discusses the benefits of reading as a hobby, not specifically for students.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is the option that aligns with the text's discussion of the benefits of reading as a hobby.

The correct answer is C

minister3:
The passage states that reading as a hobby leads to improved skills, including reading faster and better understanding. The sentence "If you read as a hobby, you will get better and better at it. And you will read faster..." directly connects the improvement in reading speed to the act of reading as a hobby. 

Option C ("if you read as a hobby") aligns with this reasoning. The other options are not supported by the text:  
- A ("after you read a book") and B ("after you finish your schoolwork") suggest specific timing, which is not mentioned.  
- D ("if you are a student") is irrelevant, as the passage does not limit the benefit to students.  

The correct answer is C.

Frank plays the guitar on the concert.

Explanation:
- The text states, "I play the guitar."
- This directly answers the question about what Frank plays on the concert.

The correct answer is B) The guitar.

minister2:
To determine what Frank plays on the concert, we need to look at the information provided in the text.

The text states that "I play the guitar." This is a direct statement from Frank, indicating that he is the one who plays the guitar.

Given this information, we can eliminate options A and B, as they suggest that Frank plays the drum, which is actually Mike's instrument. Option C is not relevant to the question, as it mentions games, which are not mentioned in the context of the concert.

Therefore, the correct answer is the one that aligns with Frank's statement about playing the guitar.

The correct answer is B

minister3:
The passage states, "I play the guitar. He plays the drum," where "I" refers to Frank. This directly indicates that Frank plays the guitar during the concert.

Query 42: "How are you?" is a nice question.It's a friendly way that people  in the United States greet each other,but "How are you?" is also a very  unusual question.It's a question that often doesn't have an answer.The person who asks "How are you?" hopes to hear the answer "Fine",  even if the Derson's friend isn't fine.The reason is that "How are you?" isn't really a question and "Fine",isn't really an answer.They are  simply other ways of saying "Hello!" or "Hi!". Sometimes,people also don't say exactly what they mean.For example,when someone asks "Do you agree?".the other person might  be thinking,"No,I disagree.I think you're wrong."But it isn't very  polite to disagree so strongly,so the other person might say "I'm not  so sure."It's a nicer way to say that you don't agree with someone. People also don't say exactly what they are thinking when they finish talking with other people.For example,many talks over the phone finish when one person says "I have to go now."Often,the person who wants to hang up gives an excuse:"Someone's at the  door.""Something is burning on the stove."The excuse might be real,or it might not.Perhaps the person who wants to hang up simply  doesn't want to talk any more,but it isn't polite to say that.The excuse is more polite,and it doesn't hurt the other person. Whether they are greeting each other,talking about an idea,or finishing a talk,people often don't say exactly what they are thinking.  It's an important way that people try to be nice to each other,and it's part of the game of language. A polite way to finish a talk is to say"  _  .".

A) You have to go now
B) I want to hang up

The text discusses how people often don't say exactly what they mean in various social interactions, such as greetings, conversations, and finishing talks. Instead, they use polite phrases to avoid hurting others' feelings or to maintain a pleasant atmosphere.

The text specifically mentions that when finishing a talk, people often give an excuse, such as "Someone's at the door" or "Something is burning on the stove," to hang up without being direct. This is presented as a polite way to end a conversation.

Now, let's examine the options:

A) You have to go now
B) I want to hang up
C) I have to go now
D) I don't want to talk

Options A and C are similar, but option C is a more common and polite way to say "You have to go now." Option B is a direct statement that might be considered impolite. Option D is also a direct statement, but it's not the most polite way to finish a conversation.

Considering the context of the text, the correct answer is the one that reflects a polite way to finish a talk without being direct.

The correct answer is C

minister3:
The passage explains that when people want to end a conversation politely, they often use excuses rather than stating their true intention directly. It specifically mentions that the phrase "I have to go now" is a common and polite way to finish a talk, even if the reason is not genuine.

Steven drives a bus that is not used for children but for dogs. He takes the dogs to a dog school where he teaches them various commands and skills. This information indicates that Steven is a dog trainer and operates a dog school. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is B) He teaches dogs in a school.

minister2:
Let's analyze the information provided in the question to determine what we know about Steven.

The question states that Steven drives a school bus, but it's not a typical school bus because it only carries dogs. This means that Steven's bus is specifically for dogs, and it takes them to a school where they learn various skills. The question also mentions that Steven teaches the dogs at this school, which implies that he is a teacher or instructor.

Now, let's examine the options:

A) He drives children to school. - This option is incorrect because the question states that Steven's bus carries dogs, not children.

B) He teaches dogs in a school. - This option is correct because the question explicitly states that Steven teaches dogs at a school.

C) He has a school for young children. - This option is incorrect because the question mentions that Steven's school is for dogs, not children.

D) He teaches children in a school. - This option is incorrect because the question states that Steven teaches dogs, not children.

The correct answer is B

Query 47: Imagine that 7 out of 10 working Americans got fired tomorrow. What would they all do? It's hard to believe it would happen. But that is what the industrial revolution did to the labor force of the early 19th century. Two hundred years ago, 70 percent of American workers lived on the farm. Today automation  has eliminated all but one percent of their jobs, replacing them with machines. But these workers did not sit, doing nothing. Instead, automation created hundreds of millions of jobs in completely new fields. Those who once farmed were then working in factories that produced farm equipment, cars, and other industrial products. It may be hard to believe, but before the end of this century, _ Yes, dear reader, even you will have your job taken away by machines. In other words, robot replacement is just a matter of time, First, speedy robots being able to lift 150 pounds all day long will carry boxes, sort them, and load them onto trucks. Fruit and vegetable picking will continue to be robotized until no humans pick outside of specialty farms. Next, The work of cleaning in offices and schools will be taken over by late-night robots. The trucks will be driven by robots. We need to let robots take over. They will do jobs we have been doing, and do them much better than we can. They will do jobs we can't do at all. They will do jobs we never imagined even needed to be done, and they will help us discover new jobs for ourselves and new tasks that expand who we are. They will let us focus on becoming more human than we were. What does the author want to tell us in the text ?
A) Why robots should take over our jobs.
B) 70% of working Americans will be jobless.
C) The industrial revolution led to the automation.
D) Robots will do more things for us to live better.

4. D) Robots will do more things for us to live better.


collaborative Response:
The author wants to convey that while automation will disrupt traditional jobs, it will also lead to significant societal benefits, including improved quality of life and increased productivity. The correct answer is:

The correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The author wants to tell us that robots will take over many jobs currently done by humans, leading to the creation of new jobs and allowing humans to focus on more human-like tasks. This is a prediction of the future impact of automation on the workforce.

The correct answer is D) Robots will do more things for us to live better.

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the text and options carefully.

The author is discussing the potential impact of automation on the workforce, citing the example of the industrial revolution and the creation of new jobs in new fields. The author emphasizes that while automation may replace some jobs, it will also create new ones and enable humans to focus on becoming more human.

Option A, "Why robots should take over our jobs," is partially correct, but it's not the main message of the text. The author is not advocating for robots to take over jobs solely for the sake of it, but rather to highlight the potential benefits of automation.

Option B, "70% of working Americans will be jobless," is incorrect. The text mentions that 70% of American workers lived on farms two hundred years ago, but it does not imply that 70% of working Americans will be jobless in the future.

Option C, "The industrial revolution led to the automation," is partially correct, but it's not the main message of the text. The author is using the industrial revolution as an example to illustrate the potential impact of automation on the workforce.

Option D, "Robots will do more things for us to live better," is the most accurate summary of the author's message. The author is emphasizing the potential benefits of automation, including the creation of new jobs and the ability for humans to focus on becoming more human.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The text uses the historical example of the industrial revolution to illustrate how automation replaces certain jobs but creates new ones in different fields. It emphasizes that while robots will take over many tasks, this shift allows humans to focus on becoming more human, discovering new jobs, and expanding their capabilities. The author's main argument is not about the inevitability of job loss (which is addressed as a hypothetical scenario) or merely describing past automation, but about the positive transformation that robot replacement can bring. The phrase "they will help us discover new jobs for ourselves and new tasks that expand who we are" directly supports the idea that robots will enable better living through new opportunities and human development. 

The correct answer is D

president:
The author is discussing how automation has historically displaced workers but also created new job opportunities. They suggest that this pattern will continue, with robots taking over various jobs, leading to new industries and allowing humans to focus on more meaningful tasks. The author's message is encouraging acceptance and preparation for the shift, emphasizing that robots will enhance our lives by handling repetitive and dangerous tasks, ultimately making us more human.

The correct answer is D

Query 48: I am especially interested in eco-friendly cars.  Would you please give me some help? -John Lily John Lily, More and more automobile companies are taking measures to create cars that do less harm to the planet. Here are some of the top green cars this year.  Tesla Roadster This is an electric sports car. You can travel 220 miles before recharging the battery. The only problem? It will cost you $ 100 000. So, until you win the lottery or happen to find a box of gold at the end of a rainbow, let's move on to the more reasonable choices. Aptera 2e This electric car is much more affordable than the Tesla Roadster, with a starting price of around $25 000. Its electric motor runs 100 miles per charge. Unfortunately, it is currently only available in California through a complex booking process. Toyota Prius At 51 miles per gallon in the city and 48 0n the highway, the Toyota Prius is one of the most fuel-efficient cars in the world  With an annual C02 rating of 1 968 kilograms, this car holds the first place on MSN's list of the Least Polluting Vehicles of 2009. It also has other eco-friendly features like a solar-powered ventilation  system. Honda Civic Hybrid  The Honda Civic Hybrid is competitive with the Toyota Prius when it comes to fuel efficiency.  It gets 40 miles per gallon in the city and 45 0n the highway. It also has the second-lowest annual CO2figure, releasing 2 160 kilograms in a year. Honda Insight Hybrid With a base price of just $20 000, the Honda Insight Hybrid is the least expensive Hybrid on the market today. Coming just after the Honda Civic and Toyota Prius in terms of pollution, this fuel-efficient vehicle gets 40 miles per gallon in the city and 43 0n the highway: Besides all these, Toyota Camry Hybrid is also a good choice. William We can infer from the passage that  _
A) as long as you have won the lottery, you can buy Tesla Roadster
B) only people in California are allowed to buy Aptera 2e
C) Honda Insight Hybrid may be the third least polluting hybrid of 2009
D) the fuel efficiency of the Aptera 2e must be the highest of all the vehicles mentioned


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: C) Honda Insight Hybrid may be the third least polluting hybrid of 2009

All answer choices:
1. A) as long as you have won the lottery, you can buy Tesla Roadster
2. B) only people in California are allowed to buy Aptera 2e
3. C) Honda Insight Hybrid may be the third least polluting hybrid of 2009
4. D) the fuel efficiency of the Aptera 2e must be the highest of all the vehicles mentioned


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is C. The passage states that the Toyota Prius has the lowest CO2 emissions, followed by the Honda Civic Hybrid, and then the Honda Insight Hybrid, making the Insight the third least polluting hybrid of 2009.

The correct answer is C.

The correct answer is C

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The passage states that the Aptera 2e is currently only available in California through a complex booking process. This means that only people in California are allowed to buy the Aptera 2e.

The correct answer is B) only people in California are allowed to buy Aptera 2e.

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the passage carefully.

The passage mentions the Tesla Roadster as an electric sports car with a high price tag of $100,000, but notes that it's not a reasonable choice for most people. It then moves on to discuss more affordable options.

The Aptera 2e is mentioned as an electric car with a starting price of around $25,000, but it's only available in California through a complex booking process. This suggests that the availability of the Aptera 2e is limited to California, but it doesn't say that only people in California are allowed to buy it.

The passage also mentions the Honda Insight Hybrid as the least expensive hybrid on the market, with a base price of just $20,000. It notes that it's coming just after the Honda Civic and Toyota Prius in terms of pollution, which implies that it's one of the least polluting hybrids of 2009.

Finally, the passage mentions that the Honda Insight Hybrid gets 40 miles per gallon in the city and 43 miles per gallon on the highway, but it doesn't compare its fuel efficiency to the Aptera 2e.

Based on this analysis, we can see that option C is the most accurate inference from the passage. The passage suggests that the Honda Insight Hybrid may be the third least polluting hybrid of 2009, but it doesn't provide enough information to confirm this.

The correct answer is C

minister3:
The passage discusses various eco-friendly cars and their features. For option A, the text mentions the Tesla Roadster's high cost but does not state that winning the lottery is the only way to purchase it, making this inference incorrect. Option B claims exclusivity to California, but the passage only notes availability there through a complex booking process, not a legal restriction. Option D incorrectly assumes the Aptera 2e's fuel efficiency is the highest, as it is electric and the passage does not compare it directly to hybrids in terms of mpg. Option C states the Honda Insight Hybrid may be the third least polluting hybrid of 2009, which aligns with the passage noting it comes "just after the Honda Civic and Toyota Prius" in pollution rankings. The correct answer is C.

Query 50: Just as the English language has changed quickly in the previous century, so has the use of it. After the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was founded in 1927, the particular style of speech of the BBC announcers was recognized as standard English or Received Pronunciation (RP) English. Now, most people still consider that the pronunciation and delivery of BBC announcers is the clearest and most understandable spoken English. English has had a strong relationship with classes and social positions. However, since the Second World War there has been a clear change of attitude towards speech snobbery , and marks of class distinction  such as styles of speech have been gradually diminishing, especially in the younger generation. By the end of the 1960s, it had become clear that it was not necessary to speak standard English or even correct grammar to become popular, successful and rich. The fashionable speech of the day was no longer the special right of a special class but rather a defiant  expression of classlessness. The greatest single influence of the shaping of the English language in modern times is the American English. Over the last 25 years the English used by many people, particularly by those in the media, advertising and show business, has become more and more mid-Atlantic in style, delivery and accent. In the 1970s, fashion favored careless pronunciation and a language full of jargon, slang and "in" words, a great quantity of which couldn't be understood by the outside world. What is considered modern and fashionable in Britain today is often not the kind of English taught in schools and colleges. It can be concluded from the passage that  _  .

Query 51: WASHINGTON -- President Obama brought together the leaders of Japan and South Korea to discuss cooperation on containing North Korea and its nuclear weapons programs. Japan and North Korea have had tense relations over unresolved issues, some of them dating back 100 years. The three leaders emphasized the importance of cooperation in dealing with North Korea. The meeting took place Tuesday in the Hague, after a twoday nuclear security summit. President Obama praised South Korean President Park Geunhye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for overcoming their differences to discuss a serious threat to regional peace. He emphasized the importance of cooperation on the North Korean nuclear issue. Obama said the three discussed steps to deepen diplomatic  and military cooperation, including joint military exercises and missile  defense against Pyongyang. He said further discussions would take place next month, during his visits to Seoul and Tokyo. The South Korean president stressed the importance of a united response to North Korea, but also called on the North to choose a peaceful path. "I sincerely hope that this meeting will offer a chance for us to reconfirm our trilateral  coordination and strengthen the cooperation on the nuclear front," said Park. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed. "Particularly it is extremely important that we were able to confirm close cooperation among Japan, the United States and the Republic of Korea on the issue of North Korea, the three countries who would like to cooperate so that North Korea will be able to take a positive position with regard to nuclear and missile issue," said Abe. Japan and South Korea have several unresolved issues, including Japan's refusal to apologize again for crimes committed 70 years ago. Former U.S. diplomat  Richard Armitage told an audience this week that painful historic injustices take a long time to heal, and that it is in Japan's interest to continue apologizing for as long as necessary. "There is a historical record of enormous generosity, achievement and respect for human rights and human freedom," said Armitage. Where can we find this article?

minister2:
To determine which statement is NOT true, let's analyze each option:

A) Mexico City is the capital of Mexico. This statement is true, as mentioned in the passage.

B) The population of Mexico City is 30,000,000. The passage actually states that the population of Mexico City is about 30 million people, not 30,000,000. This statement is incorrect.

C) Tokyo is one of the cities with the largest population. This statement is true, as Tokyo is indeed one of the cities with a large population, and it is mentioned in the passage that Mexico City has more people than Tokyo.

D) Mexico City is the highest city in the world. This statement is not entirely accurate, as the passage states that Mexico City is one of the highest capital cities in the world, but it does not claim it is the highest city in the world.

However, the most accurate answer is B) The population of Mexico City is 30,000,000, as it is the only statement that is directly contradicted by the passage.

The correct answer is B

minister3:
The passage states that Mexico City is "one of the highest capital cities in the world," not the highest city overall. While it mentions the city's elevation (7349 feet) and its status as the largest city in Mexico, it does not claim it is the highest city in the world. Option D incorrectly asserts this. The other options are directly supported by the text: A and B are explicitly stated, and C is implied by the comparison to Tokyo. 

The correct answer is D

Query 53: The day my husband fell to his death,it started to snow,just like any November day.His body,when I found it,was lightly covered with snow.It snowed almost every day for the next four months,while I sat on the couch and watched it pile up.One morning,I _ downstairs and was surprised to see a snow remover clearing my driveway and the bent back of a woman shoveling my walk.I dropped to my knees,crawled through the living room.And back up stairs so those good people would not see me.I was embarrassed.My first thought was,how would I ever repay them? I didn't have the strength to brush my hair let alone shovel someone's walk. Before John's death,I took pride in the fact that I rarely asked for help or favors,I defined myself by my competence and independence.So who was I if I was no longer capable and busy? How could I respect myself if all I did was sit on the couch every day and watch the snowfall? Learning how to receive the love and support that came my way wasn't easy.Friends cooked forme and l cried because I couldn't even help them set the table."I'm not usually this lazy,"I wept.Finally,my friend Kathy sat down with me and said,"Mary,cooking for you is not a burden. I love you and I want to do it.It makes me feel good to be able to do something for you." Over and over,I heard similar emotions from the people who supported me during those dark days.One very wise man told me,"You are not doing nothing.Being fully open to your sorrow may be the hardest work you will everdo." I am not the person I once was,but in many ways I have changed for the better.My heart is now filled with thanks for people around me.I have been surprised to learn that there is incredible freedom that comes from facing one's worst fear and walking away whole.I believe there is strength,for sure,in accepting a dark period of our life.

The writer wrote the passage to:

C) show her thanks to the people who love and support her

The passage is a reflection on the writer's experience after her husband's death, focusing on the support she received from friends and the changes she went through. She expresses gratitude for the help she received and acknowledges the growth she experienced during this difficult time. The passage is not about sharing her sad story (A), expressing guilt (B), or solely describing the changes she made (D).

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the passage and options carefully.

The passage is a personal and reflective account of the writer's experience after her husband's death. She describes her initial feelings of embarrassment and helplessness, but also her gradual acceptance of the love and support from her friends and family. The writer reflects on how she has changed as a person, learning to receive help and appreciate the value of relationships.

Option A, "share her sad story with us," is a possible interpretation, but it's not the primary purpose of the passage. The writer does share her sad story, but it's not the main focus.

Option B, "express her guilty conscience to the people who helped her," is not accurate. The writer does not express guilt, but rather gratitude and appreciation for the people who helped her.

Option C, "show her thanks to the people who love and support her," is a close option, but it's not the primary purpose of the passage. The writer does express thanks and appreciation, but the passage is more focused on her personal growth and transformation.

Option D, "tell us the changes she has made because of her husband's death," is the most accurate answer. The writer explicitly states that she has changed for the better, learned to appreciate relationships, and found strength in accepting her sorrow.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The passage details the author's emotional journey after her husband's death, highlighting her initial struggle with grief and embarrassment when receiving help from others. While the story includes elements of sadness and personal change, the central theme revolves around her eventual realization and gratitude for the love and support she received. The narrative emphasizes her transformation into a more appreciative and thankful person, as seen in the lines, "My heart is now filled with thanks for people around me" and "I believe there is strength... in accepting a dark period of our life." These statements underscore her gratitude rather than merely sharing her sadness or detailing her changes. The author’s focus on the emotional impact of receiving help and her heartfelt thanks aligns most closely with option C. 

The correct answer is C

Query 55: Dear Amy, My husband is a loving, creative and sensitive person who is 15 years my senior. (I am in my mid-30s.) Now I still struggle with my ups and downs, and he is still broke. I have continually asked my husband to get a job. I know he's trying, but even a part-time job at a convenience store would make ends meet. His former profession as a freelance  producer dropped off with the economy, and while he tries hard to find work in his field, he is extremely unwilling to accept the fact that he may need to get a "regular"job. I love him very much, but I can't continue to keep my frustration bottled up. I tell myself I'm going to leave him if he doesn't find work, but I really want to stay together. How should I handle this? Round the Bend Dear Round, Having been a freelancer for many years, I assure you (and him) that the true meaning of freelancing is that you have the freedom to accept a variety of jobs, as well as the responsibility to make a living between jobs. Freelancers teach, tend bar, sell things door to door and do anything it takes to bring home the money. Volunteering is also a wonderful way to keep busy and meet new people. Amy Dear Amy, "Joan" was a 50-year-old reader who wants to spend her parents' gift (money) on a trip to India. Her retirement fund  is less than half of what she will need for retirement. It's also clear that she hasn't budgeted monthly for car repairs and other out-of-pocket expenses. In your answer, you encourage her to go. She's 50 and the clock is ticking! How will she feel about the trip she took when she turns 70 when she can't afford to retire? Maybe there are other ways she can experience Indian food, culture, history and art without spending the entire sum of money. When her "health slows her down." she may wish she had kept a rainy-day fund. Realistic Reader Dear Realistic, Your argument is very logical and realistic, but there are also times when you have to go for it. I hope she does. Amy What makes Miss Round so upset?
A) Her husband doesn't love her as much as when they met.
B) Her husband doesn't earn enough money to support the family.

Query 56: Many people would interpret "The American dream" as "living like an American"--a two-story house with a white picket fence; a family with two cars; and two children. However, the economic situation is now affecting the American way of life for 4.4 million people living in the US, according to new census   data. "It's going to have a long-term impact and to say it's going to end is optimistic, " says Cheryl Russell, former editor-in- chief of American Demographics magazine. "I'm more pessimistic that this is the new normal." So what is the new normal? *Marrying later. The average age of the first marriage has increased to 28.7 for men and 26.7 for women, up from 27.5 and 25.9 respectively in 2006. At the same time, fewer people are getting married. If the marriage rate had stayed the same as in 2006, there would have been about 4 million more married people in 2010. *Fewer babies. There were 200,000 fewer births among women aged 20 to 34 in 2010 compared with two years before. This was despite the fact that the number of women of childbearing age had gone up by more than 1 million. "The recession  is the likely cause ," says Kenneth Johnson, demographer at the University of New Hampshire's Carsey Institue, "Economic fertility  " because women delay ...in uncertain times. *Breaking up is harder. The number of divorces has been falling for 25 years as people wait longer or choose to live together before they get married. There were about 65,000 fewer divorces in 2010 than in 2008, a 7 percent decrease. *Crowd living. Unemployment is forcing more people to live together. The number of households where people lived with "other  s" climbed from 6.7 percent in 2006 to 7.2 percent in 2010. *Going public. Private school enrollment decreased from 13.6 percent in 2006 to 12.8 percent in 2010. *Fewer cars. The percentage of households without a car rose to 9.1 percent against 8.8 percent in 2006. The percent-age of households with two or more cars fell from 58 percent to 57.1 percent. *Driving solo. When people are not working, they don't carpool. The proportion of people aged 16 to 64 in employment dropped greatly in all but one of the 50 largest metropolitan   areas. That has helped push the share of people driving to work alone from 76 percent in 2006 to 76.6 percent in 2010. Ride-sharing is down a full percentage point, to 9.7 percent. What might Cheryl Russell agree with according to the article?
A) A traditional lifestyle is much better and healthier.
B) The new study based on the members' financial reports.
C) The spirit of American dream will inspire Americans to get through the economic recession.

minister1:
The article discusses the impact of the economic recession on various aspects of American life, including marriage, childbearing, housing, and transportation. Cheryl Russell, a former editor-in-chief of American Demographics magazine, is quoted as being pessimistic about the long-term impact of the recession and suggests that these changes are likely to become the "new normal." Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is D) American lifestyles are being reshaped and will continue to change

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided in the article and the options given.

The article discusses the changes in American lifestyles due to the economic situation, citing data from the census and other sources. It highlights the following changes: marrying later, fewer babies, breaking up is harder, crowd living, going public, fewer cars, and driving solo.

Option A, "A traditional lifestyle is much better and healthier," is not supported by the article, which presents a more nuanced view of the changes in American lifestyles, highlighting the challenges and difficulties faced by many people.

Option B, "The new study based on the members' financial reports," is not mentioned in the article, which focuses on census data and demographic trends.

Option C, "The spirit of American dream will inspire Americans to get through the economic recession," is not supported by the article, which presents a more pessimistic view of the situation, with Cheryl Russell stating that the changes may be the "new normal."

Option D, "American lifestyles are being reshaped and will continue to change," is the most accurate reflection of the article's message. The article presents various statistics and trends that demonstrate how the economic situation is affecting American lifestyles, and Cheryl Russell's statement suggests that these changes may be long-term.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The article discusses how economic challenges are altering traditional aspects of American life, such as marriage patterns, family size, household structures, and transportation habits. Cheryl Russell, a former editor-in-chief, emphasizes that these changes are long-term and suggests that referring to them as a temporary "end" is overly optimistic, implying they are becoming the new norm. Her statement reflects an acknowledgment of ongoing societal shifts rather than a return to traditional lifestyles or a belief in the American dream's resilience. The data presented supports the idea that American lifestyles are being reshaped by economic factors, and Russell's pessimism about the situation reverting aligns with the notion that these changes will persist.

The text states that Donald Watson lived a very long life, dying at the age of 95. This information is explicitly mentioned in the text. The other options are not supported by the text:

- Watson did not refuse to eat meat at 20; he stopped eating meat after seeing a pig being killed when he was a boy.
- Watson did not help kill a pig on a farm; he was saddened by the sight and decided to stop eating meat.
- The text does not mention Watson enjoying good food very much.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
The correct answer is A

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the text and options carefully.

The text states that Donald Watson was born in 1910 and died in 2005, which is a very great age. It also mentions that Watson decided not to eat meat when he was a boy, and 20 years later, he decided to become a vegan, which means he wouldn't eat anything from animals, including milk, cheese, or eggs.

Option A) "lived a very long life" is correct because the text states that Watson died at the age of 95, which is indeed a very long life.

Option B) "refused to eat meat at 20" is not correct because the text states that Watson decided not to eat meat when he was a boy, not at the age of 20.

Option C) "helped kill a pig on a farm" is not correct because the text states that Watson was very sad when he saw a man killing a pig, and it implies that he did not participate in the killing.

Option D) "enjoyed good food very much" is not correct because the text states that Watson thought a lot about the food he ate and decided not to eat food from animals.

The correct answer is A

minister3:
The text states that Donald Watson was born in September 1910 and died in November 2005, which confirms he lived to the age of 95. This directly supports option A. Option B is incorrect because the text does not specify he stopped eating meat at age 20, only that he became vegan twenty years after witnessing the pig's killing. Option C contradicts the text, as Watson was saddened by the pig's death, not involved in it. Option D is unsupported, as the passage focuses on his ethical stance rather than his enjoyment of food.

The question describes Lyra's role and actions in the movie "The Golden Compass" based on Philip Pullman's novel "His Dark Materials." Let's analyze the options:

A) is a student in Oxford's Jordan College - This is correct. The movie starts with Lyra being a student at Jordan College in Oxford.

B) is a kitchen boy - This is incorrect. Roger is the kitchen boy, not Lyra.

C) hears a conversation of Roger's - This is incorrect. Lyra hears a conversation about a very tiny particle, not Roger's conversation.

D) meets many strange creatures - This is correct. Lyra meets various strange creatures like witches, goblins, and other magical beings during her adventure.

The correct answer is A) is a student in Oxford's Jordan College.

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided in the passage.

The passage describes Lyra as a young girl who lives in Oxford's Jordan College, where she spends most of her time with her friend Roger, a kitchen boy. However, it does not explicitly state that Lyra is a student in the college or that she is a kitchen boy herself. Instead, it mentions that Roger is a kitchen boy.

The passage also mentions that Lyra hears a conversation about a tiny particle, which sets off a chain of events that leads her to meet various strange creatures and embark on a perilous journey.

The correct answer is not C) hears a conversation of Roger's, as the passage states that Lyra hears a conversation about a tiny particle, not Roger's conversation.

The correct answer is not D) meets many strange creatures, as while Lyra does meet strange creatures, this is not the statement that is being completed in the sentence.

The correct answer is A) is a student in Oxford's Jordan College, as the passage states that Lyra is a young girl who lives in Oxford's Jordan College.

The correct answer is B) is a kitchen boy, as the passage states that Roger is a kitchen boy, not Lyra.

However, the sentence is incomplete, and it seems to be asking for a verb to complete the sentence. Based on the context, the most likely verb to complete the sentence is "is". Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is A

This option (B) is the only one that completes the sentence correctly and fits the context of the question.

The correct answer is B.

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided in the passage.

The passage states that users often complain about Little Smart's bad voice. This suggests that the current version of Little Smart has a poor voice quality. However, it also mentions that scientists are trying to make Little Smart smarter, implying that improvements are being made. Furthermore, it specifically states that the latest Little Smart even has a color screen, indicating that it has undergone some upgrades.

Considering the options provided:

A) has good sounds - This contradicts the information in the passage, which states that users complain about Little Smart's bad voice.
B) has a colour screen - This is consistent with the information in the passage, which states that the latest Little Smart has a color screen.
C) has a bad voice - This is consistent with the information in the passage, but it is a characteristic of the current version of Little Smart, not the latest one.
D) is not smarter - This is also consistent with the information in the passage, but it is a general statement about Little Smart in general, not specifically about the latest version.

Given the information in the passage, the correct answer is the one that describes a characteristic of the latest Little Smart.

The correct answer is B

minister3:
The passage states that the latest version of Little Smart "even has a color screen," which directly corresponds to option B. While earlier versions had issues with voice quality (option C), the text does not indicate that the latest model retains this flaw. Additionally, the mention of scientists working to improve its intelligence suggests the latest version may be smarter, making option D incorrect. Option A is not supported by the passage, as it does not comment on sound quality improvements. 

The correct answer is B

president:
The correct answer is B. The latest Little Smart has a color screen.

- Socks: Black, white, green
- Sweater: Black
- Hat: Blue, white
- T-shirt: Red, green
- Shoes: Black and white
- Bag: Blue

The only blue items available are the hat and the bag. Therefore, Mary will buy the hat and the bag.

The correct answer is C) hat and bag.

minister2:
To determine which option Mary will buy, we need to analyze the information given in the table and the condition that Mary only likes blue.

The table shows the following items that are blue:

- Hat: Blue, white
- Bag: Blue

Since Mary likes blue, she will buy items that are blue. Among the options given, only option C) hat and bag includes both blue items.

The correct answer is C

minister3:
Mary only likes blue, so she will buy items that are explicitly blue. The hat is available in blue and white, making blue a valid option. The bag is specifically blue. Other items (socks, sweater, t-shirt, shoes) do not include blue as one of their colors. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 

The correct answer is C

president:
Mary only likes blue items. From the list:

- **Socks**: Black, white, green (no blue)
- **Sweater**: Black (no blue)
- **Hat**: Blue, white (blue is available)

Query 62: There's no shortage of web sites offering deals-everything from daily deals to members-only private sales.But when it comes to real jaw-dropping deals, there's one company that seems to have figured out a out a way to really deliver. The company is called QuiBids and they auction  the hottest, in-demand electronics like Apple ipads and ipods, as well as other items like gift cards from the top retailers .Unlike other sites, the prices people pay are nowhere near retail.How low are the prices? $33.84 for a new Apple ipad 32 GB(retail $600) $22.10 for a new Nikon D90 Digital SLR Camera(retail $1070) Our first reaction on seeing these prices was disbelief.After all, how cold QuiBids possibly afford to sell these items for so little-surely they must be losing a lot of money. That's where its unique business model comes into play.You see, for every bid a buyer places for an item on QuiBids, the company collects a small fee from the bidder.The fee to bid is only about 60 cents, but based on the volume of sales and bids, the company is able to collect enough to make up for the ridiculous prices the items sell for. But best of all, participating in the QuiBids auction is incredibly fun.Because each each bid costs a little to place, shoppers can strategize when to place their bids.Each auction has a strict time limit.When you place your bid, the system adds a little time to the auction to see if any other bids cone in.If you have the winning bid when the cock runs out-you  win the item for that price. But the best part of Quibids may be the "Buy-It-Now"feature.This allows bidders who did not win an auction to still buy the product they want and apply the cost of the bids they placed as a discount on the regular product price. So you still get the item and the bids you placed previously in the auction don't cost you anything! Which might be the most suitable title for the passage ?
A) How to Buy New Must -have Electronics

C) The Most Successful Shopping Website

The correct answer is B

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The passage discusses a unique business model of a company called QuiBids, which auctions electronics and other items at significantly lower prices than retail. The company's business model involves collecting fees from each bid placed, which allows them to sell items at such low prices. The passage also highlights the fun aspect of participating in these auctions and the "Buy-It-Now" feature that allows bidders to purchase items even if they didn't win the auction. The most suitable title for the passage would be:

B) Buy Products for Next to Nothing

The correct answer is B.

minister2:
To determine the most suitable title for the passage, let's analyze the content and options carefully.

The passage discusses QuiBids, a company that auctions off in-demand electronics and other items at significantly lower prices than retail. The prices mentioned in the passage are indeed "ridiculous" and "jaw-dropping," with examples including a new Apple iPad for $33.84 (retail $600) and a new Nikon D90 Digital SLR Camera for $22.10 (retail $1070). The passage explains that QuiBids' unique business model allows them to collect a small fee from each bid, enabling them to make up for the low prices. The passage also highlights the fun and strategic aspect of participating in QuiBids auctions, as well as the "Buy-It-Now" feature that allows bidders to purchase the product at a discounted price after an auction.

Considering the content, let's evaluate the options:

A) How to Buy New Must-have Electronics: This option is somewhat relevant, as the passage does discuss buying new electronics, but it doesn't specifically focus on the "how-to" aspect.

B) Buy Products for Next to Nothing: This option is the most accurate, as the passage emphasizes the significantly low prices offered by QuiBids, with examples of products selling for a fraction of their retail prices.

C) The Most Successful Shopping Website: While QuiBids is described as having a unique business model, the passage doesn't explicitly state that it is the most successful shopping website.

D) Tips on Shopping Online: This option is not relevant, as the passage doesn't provide general tips on shopping online; it focuses specifically on QuiBids and its business model.

The correct answer is B

minister3:
The passage primarily discusses QuiBids' unique approach to selling high-demand electronics and gift cards at significantly lower prices than retail, emphasizing its auction model and the "Buy-It-Now" feature. While it mentions the company's business model and the fun aspect of bidding, the core focus is on the affordability of products. Option A focuses on "how to buy," which is not the main intent. Option C and D are too general or unrelated to the specific pricing strategy highlighted. Option B directly captures the essence of the passage by highlighting the low cost of products. 

The correct answer is B

Query 63: A graded reader is a book containing simplified languages used to help learners master the language. Readers come in different levels, from beginners to advanced. English learners need to choose a reader that is suitable for their level. Why use readers? Lots of research shows that extensive reading improves all aspects of language learning, including vocabulary, speaking skills, fluency ,writing skills and reading comprehension. prefix = st1 /Reading is a way of learning English without classes or a teacher. It helps develop learner independence. And while reading graded readers, learners don't have to run to a dictionary because the language is at their level. How do I get started? The entire class can read the same book or different books at different times. How do I know the right level? If your class is all reading the same book, choose one that is appropriate for their level. If your students are reading different books, you can have a selection of books at different levels. In this case, don't worry too much about the level. A learner who is interested in detective stories might read a higher level book if the motivation is there. How to read the book depends on students' age, motivation and class time available. Some classes like to read silently, others like to read aloud in small groups and some enjoy being read to by the teacher. Be sensitive to the class and ask for their opinions. Some pre-reading activities are needed. Before students open a book, it is important to spark interest in the story and in the whole process of reading. For example, ask them to guess what the story is from cover, chapter titles and let students put them in the best order, or discuss the author. During reading, choose a suitable chapter or chapters that can be broken down to make a comic strip  . Or students select a part of the book to make into a radio play. Students can also become journalists and report on parts of the story. Choose a piece of action and have students write it up. Besides, students can role-play an interview with a character. From the passage, we can learn that_.
A) readers can make classroom fun
B) reading can help develop learners dependence
C) some pre-reading activities are not needed

Additionally, it mentions the importance of pre-reading activities to spark interest in the story and the whole process of reading.

The passage does not mention that readers can make classroom fun, so option A is incorrect. It does not suggest that reading can help develop learner dependence, so option B is incorrect. The passage clearly states that some pre-reading activities are needed, so option C is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that extensive reading improves all aspects of language learning, making option D correct.

The correct answer is D.

minister2:
To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the passage.

The passage highlights the benefits of using graded readers in language learning, including improving vocabulary, speaking skills, fluency, writing skills, and reading comprehension.

Now, let's analyze the options:

A) readers can make classroom fun - This is a possible benefit of using readers, but it is not the main point of the passage.

B) reading can help develop learners dependence - This is the opposite of what the passage states, which is that reading helps develop learner independence.

C) some pre-reading activities are not needed - The passage actually suggests that some pre-reading activities are necessary to spark interest in the story and the reading process.

D) extensive reading improves all aspects of language learning - This is a key point made in the passage, which states that lots of research shows that extensive reading improves all aspects of language learning.

Query 64: Forty-three years seems like a long time to remember the name of a mere acquaintance. I have forgotten the name of an old lady, who was a customer on the paper route in my home town when I was a twelve-year-old boy. Yet it stays in my memory, for she taught me a lesson of forgiveness that I shall never forget. On a winter afternoon, a friend and I were throwing stones onto the leaning roof of the old lady's house from a spot near her backyard. The object of our play was to observe how the stones changed to missiles as they rolled to the roof's edge and shot out into the yard. I found myself a perfectly smooth rock and threw it out. The stone, however, slipped from my hand and headed straight for a small window on the old lady's back porch. At the sound of fractured glass, we knew we were in trouble. We ran as fast as possible. I was too scared about getting caught to be concerned about the old lady with the broken window in winter. However, a few days later, when I was sure that I hadn't been discovered, I started to feel guilty for her misfortune. She still greeted me with a smile each day when I gave her the paper, but I was no longer able to act comfortably in her presence.  I made up my mind that I would save my paper delivery money, and after three weeks I had the seven dollars that I thought would cover the cost of her window. I put the money in an envelope with a note explaining that I was sorry for breaking her window and hoped that the seven dollars would cover the cost. I put the letter through the letter slot in her door. My soul felt  _ and I could have the freedom of, once again, looking straight into the old lady's kind eyes. The next day, I handed the old lady her paper and was able to return the warm smile that I was receiving from her. She gave me a bag of cookies. I thanked her and felt an envelope in it. When I opened the envelope, inside it were the seven dollars and a short note reading, "I'm proud of you." How did the writer get to know the old lady?   _
A) They were neighbors.
B) The writer often played near the lady's house.
C) The lady was the writer's customer.
D) They got to know each other by chance.


Reference Answer:

1. A) They were neighbors.
2. B) The writer often played near the lady's house.
3. C) The lady was the writer's customer.
4. D) They got to know each other by chance.


collaborative Response:
The writer got to know the old lady because she was his customer on the paper route. This is evident from the text, which states, "She still greeted me with a smile each day when I gave her the paper." Therefore, the correct answer is:

C) The lady was the writer's customer.

The correct answer is C.

The correct answer is C

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The writer got to know the old lady because she was a customer on the paper route in his home town when he was a twelve-year-old boy. This is explicitly stated in the passage: "She was a customer on the paper route in my home town when I was a twelve-year-old boy."

Therefore, the correct answer is:
C) The lady was the writer's customer.

minister2:
Let's analyze the question and options carefully.

The passage states that the writer was a twelve-year-old boy who had a paper route in his home town. It also mentions that the old lady was a customer on the paper route, which means that the writer delivered newspapers to her house. This establishes a direct connection between the writer and the old lady.

Option A, "They were neighbors," is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention that the writer and the old lady lived near each other.

Option B, "The writer often played near the lady's house," is also not supported by the passage, as it only mentions that the writer and a friend were throwing stones onto the old lady's house from a spot near her backyard, but it does not indicate that this was a regular activity.

Option D, "They got to know each other by chance," is not accurate, as the passage suggests that the writer and the old lady had a regular interaction through the paper route.

Option C, "The lady was the writer's customer," is the most accurate option, as it is explicitly stated in the passage that the old lady was a customer on the writer's paper route.

The correct answer is C

minister3:
The passage explicitly states that the old lady was a customer on the paper route, which directly indicates the writer's relationship with her. While the writer and friend interacted with her house by throwing stones, this was a separate activity unrelated to their primary connection. The key detail is the paper delivery service, establishing her as a customer. Other options, such as neighbors or chance encounters, are not supported by the text. The correct answer is C.

6. The stories often involve misunderstandings leading to a happy reunion.

Given this information, the process of writing computer fictions does not involve thinking hard about the plot or expressing personal desires. Instead, it involves collecting and using materials that have already been gathered and processed by a computer.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
The correct answer is B) collect materials from many places

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the text and options carefully.

The text describes the process of writing computer fiction, which involves collecting materials from various places, such as women's ideas about life and love, their happiness and sufferings, and emotions.

A) think hard: The text explicitly states that writers don't have to think about making a plot, which contradicts this option.

B) collect materials from many places: This option is consistent with the text, which describes the writers collecting materials from various places.

C) express what they want to: The text does not mention the writers expressing their own desires or opinions, so this option is not supported.

D) describe women's sufferings and emotions: While the text does mention that the writers collect materials about women's sufferings and emotions, this is not the primary description of what the writers do when writing computer fiction.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is the option that aligns with the text's description of the writing process.

The correct answer is B

minister3:
The passage explains that writers of computer fiction do not need to create plots themselves but instead collect materials from various places. It specifically mentions that they "go to a lot of places and collect materials" such as women's desires, ideas about life and love, and their emotions. This process involves gathering data, which is then processed and classified by the computer. The writers subsequently select from these materials and add details to form a story. While options C and D reference aspects of the collected materials (expressing personal desires or focusing on women's emotions), the passage emphasizes the act of gathering information as the primary method. Option A is contradicted by the text, which states that writers do not have to think about making a plot. Therefore, the most accurate answer is B, as it directly aligns with the described process of collecting materials from many places.

Query 66: Have you ever been in a meeting while someone was making a speech and realized suddenly that your mind was a million miles away? You probably felt sorry and decided to pay attention and never have daydreaming again. Most of us have been told from earliest school days that daydreaming is a waste of time. I don't think so. L. Giambra, a psychologist, says, "Daydreaming isn't a waste of time. _ , daydreaming is quite necessary. Without it, the mind couldn't do all the thinking that it has to do during a normal day. You can't possibly do all your thinking with a conscious mind. Instead, your unconscious mind is working out problems all the time. Daydreaming may be one way that the unconscious and conscious states of mind have silent conversations ." Early psychologists paid no attention to the importance of daydreams or even thought they were harmful . At one time people thought that some psychological illness caused daydreaming. They did not have a better understanding of daydreams until the late 1980s. Eric Klinges, a professor, is the writer of the book Daydreaming. Klinges says, "We know now that daydreaming is one of the main ways that we organize our lives, learn from our experiences, and plan for our futures. Daydreams really are a window on the things that we are afraid and the things we long for   in life." Daydreams are usually very simple and direct, quite unlike sleep dreams. Sleep dreams may be hard to understand. It's easier to get a deep understanding of your life by paying close attention to your daydreams than by trying to examine  your sleep dreams carefully. Daydreams help you know the difficult situations in your life and found out a possible way of dealing with them. Daydreams cannot be predicted: they move off in unexpected directions which may be creative and full of useful ideas. For many famous artists and scientists, daydreams were and are a main source  of creative energy. Psychologists now believe that   _  .

Query 67: For the kids in Matt Marciano's sixth-grade social studies class, Thanks-giving is a time for great ideas. "We look at different foods that people eat around the world," says Marciano. "The lesson," he explains, "teaches students to admit that some people are unlucky. And it also gets them thinking about Thanksgiving, about their lives, and about their biggest homework of the year--to find a way they can change the world."  Last year, 12-year-old Christian D. taught basic soccer skills to 63 kids with cancer. Christian's classmate Brianna used the money she had raised to buy 56 teddy bears. She donated them to a woman's shelter. Both students say the experience taught them something they'll never forget: When we give something to others, we're really giving thanks. And giving thanks feels good.   "Helping the woman smile, if just for a day, made me feel like I could make a difference," Brianna says. "And it taught me that I should always be thankful for what I have." Brianna's happiness is something Jeffrey Froh knows about. Froh studies how gratitude affects a person's mind and attitudes. Those who are thankful are more likely to help others. Grateful people and kids in particular are healthier and happier than those who are not. "Grateful kids tend to be happier and more satisfied with their lives," Froh says. "Kids who give thanks are happier with school, their families and their friends. Grateful children also feel less envy toward others, are less likely to be depressed and even do better in school."  "To experience gratitude," says Froh, "a couple of things have to happen. First you have to notice that there is goodness in your life. Then you have to admit that the reason for that goodness lies partially outside of yourself." Which word can be used to describe the grateful kids?

- They are less likely to be depressed.
- They do better in school.

Given these points, the word that best describes the grateful kids is "Positive."

The correct answer is B) Positive.

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided in the passage.

The passage highlights the benefits of gratitude, particularly in children. It mentions that grateful kids tend to be happier, more satisfied with their lives, and less likely to experience negative emotions such as envy and depression. The passage also states that grateful children do better in school and are more likely to help others.

Given this information, we can infer that the word that best describes the grateful kids is one that conveys a positive attitude or outlook.

Option A, "Rude," is not a characteristic associated with grateful kids, as the passage emphasizes their positive and helpful nature.

Option C, "Sad," is also not a characteristic of grateful kids, as they are described as happier and more satisfied with their lives.

Option D, "Envious," is actually a characteristic that grateful kids are less likely to exhibit, according to the passage.

Option B, "Positive," is the most fitting description of grateful kids, as they are described as happier, more satisfied, and more likely to help others.

The correct answer is B

minister3:
The passage describes grateful kids as being healthier, happier, and more satisfied with their lives. It also mentions they feel less envy and are less likely to be depressed. These traits align with a positive outlook. The examples of their actions (helping others, donating items) further illustrate their positive impact and mindset. The other options (rude, sad, envious) contradict the text's emphasis on gratitude fostering happiness and reducing negative emotions. 

The correct answer is B.

president:
The correct answer is C

Query 68: Anyone who has ever lost keys or money will have wished for a simple but effective way to make sure it never happens again. A US company is trying to help. Using a tiny microchip which is implanted into the arm, they have come up with a replacement for cash or credit cards that cannot be left at home or dropped on the bus. The Verichip is about the size of a grain of rice and works using radio frequency identification technology. At a shop, a radio frequency "reader" would send a signal and the chip in your arm would respond with your unique identity number. That would give the "reader" your financial information, and money could be taken directly from your accounts and you wouldn't even have to reach for your wallet. The company also hopes to include other information on the chip, such as medical records, building security codes   and passwords, making life even easier. But not everyone is happy with the developments. Critics say that a lot can go wrong with the chip. A clever thief could build a fake   reader that would steal your information without you knowing. So your money could still be stolen. Privacy is a big issue too. Stores, or even the government, only need to track the chip to find out what you buy, how much you spend and where you go. And if you wanted to get rid of your chip, you would need an operation to remove it. The Verichip is   _  .
A) the identity number
B) the security code
C) a tiny microchip
D) a radio reader


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: C) a tiny microchip

All answer choices:
1. A) the identity number
2. B) the security code
3. C) a tiny microchip
4. D) a radio reader


collaborative Response:
The Verichip is a tiny microchip, about the size of a grain of rice, that is implanted into the arm. It uses radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to store and transmit information such as financial details, medical records, building security codes, and passwords. This technology allows users to make purchases without needing to carry cash or credit cards, as a radio frequency reader at a shop can send a signal to the chip, prompting it to respond with the user's unique identity number. This response enables the reader to access the user's financial information and deduct the amount directly from their accounts. However, there are significant concerns regarding privacy and security. A potential risk is that a thief could create a fake reader to steal information, though this would require technical expertise. Additionally, the chip could be used to track users' purchases and spending habits, raising privacy issues. Removing the chip would require an operation, which may not be a major concern for all users. While the Verichip offers convenience, it also poses risks that need to be carefully managed to ensure user safety and privacy.

Query 69: In making a pizza, which process involves a chemical change?
A) mixing spices for the sauce
B) slicing pepperoni for the topping
C) spreading cheese on the pizza
D) baking the dough to form the crust


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: D) baking the dough to form the crust

All answer choices:
1. A) mixing spices for the sauce
2. B) slicing pepperoni for the topping
3. C) spreading cheese on the pizza
4. D) baking the dough to form the crust


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
To determine which process involves a chemical change in making a pizza, we need to consider the definition of a chemical change. A chemical change occurs when the composition of a substance is altered, typically resulting in the formation of new substances.

- **Mixing spices for the sauce**: This process involves physical mixing of ingredients, not a chemical change.
- **Slicing pepperoni for the topping**: This is a physical process of cutting the pepperoni, not a chemical change.
- **Spreading cheese on the pizza**: This is a physical process of applying cheese to the pizza, not a chemical change.
- **Baking the dough to form the crust**: This process involves heating the dough, which causes a chemical reaction (specifically, the Maillard reaction) that changes the composition of the dough, resulting in the formation of new substances like crust.

Therefore, the process that involves a chemical change is baking the dough to form the crust.

The correct answer is D.

minister2:
To determine which process involves a chemical change, let's analyze each option:

A) Mixing spices for the sauce: This process involves combining different ingredients, but it does not involve a chemical reaction that alters the chemical composition of the ingredients. It's a physical change, as the spices are simply being mixed together.

B) Slicing pepperoni for the topping: Slicing pepperoni is a physical change, as it involves changing the shape and size of the pepperoni without altering its chemical composition.

C) Spreading cheese on the pizza: This process is also a physical change, as it involves distributing the cheese evenly over the pizza without altering its chemical composition.

D) Baking the dough to form the crust: This process involves heat, which can cause chemical reactions to occur. When dough is baked, the starches in the flour undergo a process called gelatinization, and the proteins in the dough undergo denaturation. These chemical reactions change the structure and composition of the dough, resulting in a crust with a different texture and appearance. This is a chemical change.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The correct answer is D. 

When baking pizza dough, heat triggers chemical reactions such as the Maillard reaction and caramelization, which alter the dough's chemical composition by forming new substances (e.g., browned proteins and sugars). These processes involve changes in molecular structure, distinguishing them as chemical changes. In contrast, mixing spices, slicing pepperoni, and spreading cheese are physical changes that do not alter the chemical identity of the substances involved. 

The correct answer is D

president:
The correct answer is D

Query 70: At the end of every British summer I find myself praying for a proper winter, one that will allow a bit of fun: sledging, snowballing, snowman-building. I'm not very demanding; I don't need amazing downhill skiing and the Cresta Run. What I want is a few days out with the kids. And, much as I like blue skies and sun in summer, I'd exchange it every time for frozen ponds, a hillside covered in fresh snow and ice hanging off the houses. Maddy, 11, wants the same and so, instead of waiting and hoping, we are going to make sure. We are going to Sweden. Winter fun in Sweden is a bit more advanced than in most of the UK. They do snowshoeing, ice-fishing, snow house-building and so on. They also do lots of Father Christmas matters, which Maddy didn't want: "I'm too old for that kind of nonsense, Dad." Above all, what Maddy wanted was dogs with puppies. She's not too old for that.  We flew to Lulea, a city at the top of the finger of Baltic Sea that reaches out to the north between Sweden and Finland, almost touching the Arctic Circle, then transferred, with some other winter-hungry families, to woodland houses by the sea. There was plenty of snow and ice, but the guides were keeping a nervous eye on the instrument for measuring temperature, which was dangerously close to zero. "Normally, we are 10degC below," said Roger, our guide, who was also handing out our equipment for the days ahead: snowshoes, boots, gloves and so on. A holiday that provides all the necessary outfits will save you a fortune. What's the best title of the passage?
A) Winter Fun in Lulea.
B) A journey to Finland.
C) Ice-fishing in Lulea.
D) Snow showing in Lulea.

Query 71: Imagine having an idea, drawing it on paper, bringing it to a store and seeing it turned into a physical object. This is now possible with the help of 3D printers. Such machines were once used just by universities and big companies, but now, stores with 3D printing services are appearing around the United States. Bryan Jaycox and his wife opened The Build Shop LLC in Los Angeles two years ago. The store is filled with tools like a laser cutter, an industrial sewing machine and 3D printers. The Jaycoxs offer 3D printing classes and services for anyone who is interested. "I think 3D printing is going to be huge. It's going to have a huge effect on society as a whole." One of the students in a recent class was KiChong Tran. He plans to open a 3D printing business in Cambodia. 3D printing services are becoming available for American consumers. The UPS Store is a nationwide retailer ( ) that provides shipping, copying and other services. The UPS Store recently put 3D printers in three of its independently-owned stores. Burke Jones owns one of the stores in San Diego. "The demand has been amazing. It's been much more than I would have imagined." The UPS Store plans to add 3D printers in three more stores. At The UPS Store, the cost of the object depends on the amount of materials used. The store charges up to $95 an hour to design the object with computer software that creates a digital file to guide the printer. Mr. Jaycox predicts that within five years, 3D printing technology could become more popular. But KiChong Tran says even current technology can make a difference in a developing country like Cambodia. "With 3D printing, you can give them tools; you put it in their hands so they are responsible more for their own development and they learn skills beyond just learning English and becoming a tour guide or something like that or working at a bank; you can actually create things that give value to the world." He says it's not just in Cambodia but anywhere where there is a 3D printer that it can turn a good idea into reality. The Build Shop LLC is a store  _  .

Query 72: Dear Mr Rupp, The day I met you was the first day of high school. We liked each other immediately. You gave me a lot of advice over the next four years, like how I should get my ass to Berkeley where I belonged. I'm still there, by the way. I wish you were still around, too. I remember your laugh, which would start with a rough guffaw  and end with a hacking smoker's cough that would make even the most rebellious   teenager swear to lay off the cigarettes. I remember the way you didn't lower your standards, yet still refused to give up on us. You were tough on us, and we were tough on you. Love is tough sometimes. The last time I wrote you a letter, it was 2005---four years after I graduated. I had just become a teacher, like you, and it had given me a new appreciation for the work you did with countless high school students over the years. It's hard to say what I'll miss the most about you. There are simply too many memories to sort through those four years, and it hurts to think you'll never read this letter. I want to believe that you knew how much you meant to your family, your students, your community, and your colleagues, but that would be a lot of realization to handle, even for you. You changed the lives of everyone around you. Even now, you are reminding me to cherish life and its brevity and beauty, and to tell the people I love how much they mean to me before it is too late. Dear teacher, dear mentor, and dear friend----I miss you and all that is about you. God bless you in Heaven.

Query 75: The language used by scientists to explain complex ideas can be difficult and sometimes even boring. The language, with its Latin words and long scientific terms, could be one reason some people avoid learning about science, especially children. American Danielle Dixson is a marine biologist. She wants to make science fun for children. Dixson has turned that idea into a series of children's books. The nine books are written so that her research is easy to understand. "I just don't really think kids should be left out of it and I thought that story books may be one of the easiest ways to sort of captivate them and have them understand." Danielle Dixson is an assistant professor at the University of Delaware. Dixson says another goal of her science writing is to help increase understanding of the ocean environment. She spent almost two years in the South Pacific working on her post-doctoral research. She went to the island nation of Fiji to investigate coral reefs that are collapsing or, as she says, degrading. The goal of her research is to identify why some healthy coral reefs are breaking down. She also wants to find out how this degradation affects fish that live in and around the reefs. "A number of the reefs are converting from being, you know, these beautiful coral reef systems that have a lot of holes for animals to hide in, into reefs that the coral's degrading and collapsing and then there is not as much hiding spaces for fishes and things like that." Early in her research, Dixson made some videos for people in Fiji. The videos explained her work to the local community. She says she wanted them to understand how her research would help them. For the local children, Dixson started making books explaining her work. This helped to keep them from walking through her "laboratory" - baby pools filled with water she was using for her experiments. "I was living, actually, in the village with some of the locals. It was a lot easier to get research done if they understood what I was doing and how it would help them. And one of the ways that I was able to connect with the adults was I would make these videos for them. And then I started making children's books for the kids so that they would have a better idea of why I was there, so that when I ask them not to walk through the baby pools I was using for experiments or something like that, that that would actually happen." she added. When Dixson returned to the United States, she started doing the same thing for children in this country. She uses color1ful story books to capture the imagination of children. While she has their attention, she provides very useful information about science. As a marine scientist, Dixson wants her stories to be both educational and inspirational, serving as an agent for change. She also includes in her books "a call to action," asking readers what they can do to make a difference. "One of the things I do in those story books is I have a last page. And the last page talks about what you can do to help. You know, there is a lot of things that even a 6-year-old is able to do, whether it's shutting your lights off when you leave a room, or riding your bike to your friend's house instead of having your parents drive you. There is a lot of stuff that they can do and still feel they're making a difference." Danielle Dixson's books shine a light on the environmental problems facing our world's oceans. They also make science fun and understandable for children. But her books may have an unintended consequence, something she may not have planned on. Which of the following may be the purpose of Dixson's science writing?
A) To make the record of her research.
B) To make people aware of ocean environment
C) To raise money for her research
D) To warn people of dangerous ocean lives.

Query 76: Except for the sun, the moon looks like the biggest object in the sky. Actually it is one of the smallest, and only looks big because it is so near to us. Its diameter  is only 2,160 miles (3,389 km), or a little more than a quarter of the diameter of the earth.        Once a month, or more exactly, once every 29.5 days, at the time we call "full moon," its whole _ looks bright. At other times only part of it appears bright, and we always find that this is the part which faces towards the sun, while the part racing away from the sun appears dark. People could make their pictures better if they kept this in mind -- only those parts of the moon which are lighted up by the sun are bright. This shows that the moon gives no light of its own. It only throws back the light of the sun, like a huge mirror hung in the sky.     Yet the dark part of the moon's surface is not  ly black; generally it is just light enough for us to be able to see its outline, so that we speak of seeing "the old moon in the new moon's arms." The light by which we see the old moon does not come from the sun, but from the earth. We know well how the surface of the sea or of snow, or even of a wet road, may throw back uncomfortably much of the sun's light onto our faces. In the same way the surface of the whole earth throws back enough of the sun's light on to the face of the moon for us to be able to see the parts of it which would otherwise be dark. Why is the dark part of the moon not completely black?
A) Because the sun shines on the moon's surface.
B) Because the earth throws back sunlight onto the moon.
C) Because the moon throws back the light from the sun.
D) Because the moon has light of its own.


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: B) Because the earth throws back sunlight onto the moon.

All answer choices:
1. A) Because the sun shines on the moon's surface.
2. B) Because the earth throws back sunlight onto the moon.
3. C) Because the moon throws back the light from the sun.
4. D) Because the moon has light of its own.


collaborative Response:
The dark part of the moon's surface is not completely black because the Earth reflects sunlight onto the moon, creating a faint illumination known as earthshine. This allows the dark side of the moon to be visible, even when it is not directly facing the sun. The moon itself does not produce its own light; it reflects light from the sun. However, when the moon is not in the full phase, only the part facing the sun is illuminated by sunlight, while the dark part becomes visible due to the Earth's reflected light, known as earthshine. This phenomenon explains why the dark side of the moon is not completely black, as it is illuminated by light reflected from the Earth rather than directly by the sun.

The correct answer is B.

The correct answer is B

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The question asks why the dark part of the moon's surface is not completely black. The passage explains that the dark part of the moon's surface is not completely black because the earth throws back enough sunlight onto the moon for us to see its outline. This is similar to how the surface of the sea, snow, or a wet road reflects sunlight back to our faces.

The correct answer is:
B) Because the earth throws back sunlight onto the moon.

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided in the passage.

The passage explains that the moon appears bright when it is fully illuminated by the sun, but at other times, only part of it appears bright. This is because the part of the moon facing away from the sun is dark. However, the dark part of the moon is not completely black, but rather light enough for us to see its outline.

The passage then explains that this is because the earth's surface reflects sunlight onto the moon, allowing us to see the dark part of the moon.

Now, let's consider the options:

A) Because the sun shines on the moon's surface. - This is incorrect because the passage states that the sun's light only illuminates the part of the moon facing the sun.

B) Because the earth throws back sunlight onto the moon. - This is correct because the passage explains that the earth's surface reflects sunlight onto the moon, allowing us to see the dark part of the moon.

C) Because the moon throws back the light from the sun. - This is incorrect because the passage states that the moon only reflects the sun's light, it does not produce its own light.

D) Because the moon has light of its own. - This is incorrect because the passage states that the moon does not produce its own light, but rather reflects the sun's light.

The correct answer is B

minister3:
The passage explains that the dark part of the moon is not completely black because it reflects light from the Earth, not the sun. While the moon reflects sunlight during its illuminated phases, the dark portion is visible due to Earthshine, which is sunlight reflected off Earth's surface onto the moon. This directly contradicts options A (sunlight directly illuminates the dark part) and C (moon reflects sun's light to itself), and the text explicitly states the moon does not produce its own light (eliminating D). Thus, the correct answer is B.  

The correct answer is B

president:
The dark part of the moon isn't completely black because the Earth reflects sunlight onto the moon, providing enough light for us to see its outline.

The correct answer is B

Query 77: Which of the following is a trait that a dog does NOT inherit from its parents?
A) the length of its fur
B) the shape of its nose
C) the size of its appetite
D) the color of its fur


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: C) the size of its appetite

All answer choices:
1. A) the length of its fur
2. B) the shape of its nose
3. C) the size of its appetite
4. D) the color of its fur


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is C

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
To determine which trait a dog does NOT inherit from its parents, we need to consider the nature of genetic inheritance. Traits that are determined by genes are inherited from parents. However, the size of a dog's appetite is not a trait that is primarily determined by genetics. Instead, it is influenced by environmental factors such as diet, lifestyle, and overall health.

- A) The length of its fur: This is a genetic trait that can be inherited from parents.
- B) The shape of its nose: This is a genetic trait that can be inherited from parents.
- C) The size of its appetite: This is not primarily determined by genetics but rather by environmental factors.
- D) The color of its fur: This is a genetic trait that can be inherited from parents.

Therefore, the trait that a dog does NOT inherit from its parents is:

The correct answer is C

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:

A) The length of a dog's fur is a physical characteristic that can be influenced by genetics, so it is likely inherited from its parents.

B) The shape of a dog's nose is a physical characteristic that is determined by genetics, and is often a breed-specific trait, so it is also likely inherited from its parents.

C) The size of a dog's appetite is a behavioral trait that is influenced by a combination of genetics and environmental factors, such as diet and exercise. While there may be some genetic component to a dog's appetite, it is not a trait that is directly inherited from its parents in the same way that physical characteristics are.

D) The color of a dog's fur is a physical characteristic that is determined by genetics, so it is likely inherited from its parents.

Based on this analysis, the trait that a dog does NOT inherit from its parents is the size of its appetite.

The correct answer is C

minister3:
The correct answer is C. Traits like fur length (A), nose shape (B), and fur color (D) are determined by genetic factors passed from parents to offspring. However, the size of a dog's appetite (C) is influenced by both genetic predispositions and environmental factors such as training, diet, and individual experiences. While genetics may play a role in metabolism or eating habits, the appetite itself is not solely inherited and can vary based on external conditions.

All answer choices:
1. A) travel elsewhere
2. B) be eaten
3. C) pass a test
4. D) be washed


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is A

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options in the context of plant growth:

- **Option A: travel elsewhere** - This is not necessarily true. Seeds can germinate and grow in the same place they fall.
- **Option B: be eaten** - This is not a requirement for plant growth. In fact, being eaten would typically prevent a seed from growing.
- **Option C: pass a test** - This is not a requirement for plant growth. Seeds do not need to pass any tests to grow.
- **Option D: be washed** - This is not a requirement for plant growth. Seeds can germinate and grow without being washed.

The correct answer is **A) travel elsewhere**, as seeds often need to disperse to new locations to grow and establish new plants. This can be achieved through various means such as wind, water, or animals.

The correct answer is A

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the requirements for plant growth.

First, we need to consider the role of seeds in plant growth. Seeds are the reproductive structures of plants, containing the embryo of a new plant. For a seed to grow into a new plant, it must undergo a process called germination, where it absorbs water and begins to sprout.

Now, let's examine the options:

A) Travel elsewhere: Seeds can indeed travel elsewhere through various means such as wind, water, or animals. This process is called dispersal, and it helps to spread seeds to new locations where they can germinate and grow.

B) Be eaten: While being eaten can be a means of seed dispersal (e.g., birds eat seeds and then deposit them in a new location), it is not a necessary condition for seeds to grow.

C) Pass a test: There is no scientific basis for the idea that seeds need to "pass a test" in order to grow.

D) Be washed: While seeds may be washed away by water, this is not a necessary condition for them to grow.

Based on this analysis, the most relevant option is A) travel elsewhere, as it is a necessary step for seeds to be dispersed and germinate in a new location.

The correct answer is A

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The text primarily focuses on Marie Colvin's life, her career as a journalist, and her eventual death while covering a conflict in Syria. The text also includes her mother's recollections of her daughter's determination and passion for journalism. The best title that captures the essence of the text is:

C) Recalling Her Daughter,a Journalist Killed in Syria

The correct answer is C

minister2:
To determine the best title of the text, let's analyze the content and options carefully.

The text primarily focuses on the life and career of Marie Colvin, a journalist who was killed in Syria while working on a story. The text mentions her background, her decision to become a journalist, and her experiences as a journalist, including her work in a conflict zone. The text also includes quotes from her mother, Rosemarie Colvin, who shares her thoughts and feelings about her daughter's career and death.

Option A, "Covering Stories in a Dangerous Conflict Area," is relevant to the text, as it mentions Marie Colvin's work in a conflict zone and her decision to continue working on a story despite the danger. However, this title is not the most comprehensive or accurate representation of the text, as it only focuses on one aspect of Marie Colvin's career.

Option B, "Applying for Top Universities, a Successful Case," is not relevant to the text, as it mentions Marie Colvin's admission to Yale University, but this is only a brief aside in the text. The text does not focus on the process of applying to top universities.

Option C, "Recalling Her Daughter, a Journalist Killed in Syria," is the most accurate and comprehensive title for the text. It captures the main theme of the text, which is the life and death of Marie Colvin, a journalist who was killed in Syria. This title also includes a personal touch, as it mentions the mother's recollections of her daughter.

Option D, "Choosing Lifelong Careers Based on Your Own Interest," is not the best title for the text, as it is a bit too broad and does not specifically relate to Marie Colvin's career or death.

The correct answer is C

minister3:
The text primarily recounts the story of Marie Colvin's life, focusing on her early passion for journalism, her admission to Yale, and her eventual death while covering a conflict in Syria. While it mentions her work in dangerous areas (Option A) and her career choice (Option D), the central theme revolves around her mother's recollection of her daughter's dedication and the tragic circumstances of her death. Option B is too narrow, focusing only on university admissions. Option C encapsulates both her identity as a journalist and the emotional core of the narrative through the mother's perspective, making it the most comprehensive choice.

Query 80: A young man worked very hard on his lessons. He was too busy to have a rest. One day he found that he couldn't fall asleep at night. As he became ill, he couldn't go to sleep. When he went to bed, he closed his eyes and tried to sleep. But he always failed. After a few days he decided to see a doctor. "I just can't go to sleep at night. What should I do?" he asked. "I have a suggestion," said the doctor. "You can try to count numbers. When you count to one thousand, you will be asleep. I am sure of it. " The next day the man returned to the doctor's office. "Well," said the doctor. "How are you today? Did you try my suggestion?" The man still looked tired. "Yes," he said. "I tried to count one, two, three.. , up to one thousand. But when I counted to five hundred and sixty--nine, I began to feel sleepy. I had to get up and drink some tea so that I could go on counting up to one thousand. But then I still couldn't fall asleep. " The young man counted  _

Query 81: The drug store was closing for the night and Alfred Higgins was about to go home when his new boss approached him. "Empty your pockets please, Alfred," Sam Carr demanded in a firm voice. Alfred pretended to be shocked but he knew he had been caught. From his coat he withdrew a make-up kit, a lipstick and two tubes of toothpaste. "I'm disappointed in you, Alfred!" said the little gray-haired man. "Sorry, sir. Please forgive me. It's the first time I've ever done such a thing," Alfred lied, hoping to gain the old man's sympathy. Mr Carr's brow furrowed as he reached for the telephone, "Do you take me for a fool? Let's see what the police have to say. But first I'll call your mother and let her know her son is heading to jail." "Do whatever you want," Alfred shot back, trying to sound big. But deep down he felt like a child. He imagined his mother rushing in, eyes burning with anger, maybe in tears. Yet he wanted to come quickly before Mr. Carr called the police. Mr. Carr was surprised when Mrs. Higgins finally arrived . She was very calm, quiet and friendly. "Is Alfred in trouble?" she asked. "He's been stealing from the store," the old man coolly replied. Mrs. Higgins pulled out her hand and touched Mr. Carr's arm with great gentleness as if she knew just how he felt. She spoke as if she did not want to cause him any more trouble. "What do you want to do, Mr.Carr?" The woman's calm and gentle manner _ the once-angry store-owner, "I was going to get a cop. But I don't want to be cruel. Tell your son not to come back here again and I will let it go." Then he warmly shook Mrs. Higgins' hand. Mrs. Higgins thanked the old ma for his kindness, then mother and son left. They walked along the street in silence. When they arrived home his mother simply said, "Go to bed, you fool." In his bedroom, Alfred heard his mother in the kitchen. He felt no shame, only pride in his mother's actions. "She was smooth!" he thought. He went to the kitchen to tell her how great she was, but was shocked by what he saw. His mother's face looked frightened, broken. Not the cool, bright face he saw earlier. Her lips moved nervously. She looked very old. There were tears in her eyes. This picture of his mother made him want to cry. He felt his youth ending. He saw all the troubles he brought her and the deep lines of worry in her grey face. It seemed to him that this was the first time he had ever really seen his mother. What was the mother's attitude towards Alfred?
A) She felt disappointed with him.

collaborative Response:
The mother's attitude towards Alfred is best described as a mix of disappointment and concern. She initially approached the situation calmly and gently, indicating a desire to mediate rather than harshly punish. Her demeanor at home, marked by worry and emotional vulnerability, reveals her disappointment in his actions while also showing her concern for his future and the family's well-being. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is A) She felt disappointed with him.

The correct answer is A

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The mother's attitude towards Alfred was one of disappointment and concern. She was calm and friendly when she arrived at the store, but her demeanor changed once they were alone. When Alfred saw his mother's face in the kitchen, he realized that she was frightened and broken, indicating that she was deeply affected by his actions. She did not scold him or show anger, but her expression and body language conveyed her disappointment and worry. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is A) She felt disappointed with him.

minister2:
To determine the mother's attitude towards Alfred, let's analyze the information provided in the passage.

When Alfred and his mother are at the store, she is calm, quiet, and friendly. She speaks gently to Mr. Carr and asks him what he wants to do about the situation. This suggests that she is trying to diffuse the tension and avoid conflict.

When they are walking home, they are in silence, which implies that she is not scolding or lecturing him. This silence could also be a sign of her being disappointed or worried, but it's not explicitly stated.

When they arrive home, Alfred expects his mother to praise her for her clever actions, but instead, he sees her face change, and she appears frightened, broken, and worried. Her lips move nervously, and there are tears in her eyes. This reveals a different side of her character, one that is more vulnerable and concerned.

Considering these details, it's clear that the mother's attitude towards Alfred is not one of disappointment, strictness, or supportiveness. Instead, she is afraid of the consequences of his actions and the impact they have on her life.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The mother's attitude is revealed through her calm, gentle, and supportive actions when she arrives. She does not display anger or disappointment but instead tries to ease Mr. Carr's anger by offering a compromise, showing empathy for both the boss's frustration and Alfred's situation. Her behavior suggests she is trying to protect her son and resolve the conflict without harsh punishment. While she later appears frightened, this is a reaction to the situation, not her attitude toward Alfred. The text emphasizes her efforts to support him, not criticize or fear him.

Query 82: Every day Yang Hongwei takes the bus home from work, staring silently at the European-style villas , luxury cars and twinkling lights from the shopping center that he sees through the window. Yang works for a software company in Zhongguancun. He dreams of such a life, away from poverty, and that hope has kept him in Beijing for three years since he graduated from university. Soon Yang squeezes his way off the bus to the reality of his life: his home--a 10-square-metre room that costs 550 yuan(81 US dollars) or about one-fifth of his salary in rent every month. It's very cold inside the house as it has no central heating system. He has to stand the long and cold winter. Determined to achieve his dream, Yang says he has changed jobs "numerous" times in the past three years and is considering quitting his present job. Yang's frustration over his life as a migrant  is shared by many other graduates that have moved into big cities. Together they have come to be called the "ant tribe", a term created by Chinese sociologists to describe the struggles of young migrants, who, armed with their diplomas, flood to big cities in hopes of a better life only to put up with low-paying jobs and poor living conditions. They share every similarity with ants. They live in colonies in crowded areas. They're intelligent and hardworking, yet unknown and underpaid. The term, sociologists have said, also reflects their helplessness in a world governed by the law of the concrete jungle--only the strongest survive. A survey in Ant TribeII found nearly 30 percent of the "ants" are graduates of famous key universities--almost three times the percentage of 2009. Most have degrees in popular majors, such as medicine, engineering, economics and management. In addition, 7.2 percent of the "ants" have at least a master's degree compared to 1.6 percent in 2009. Most said the economic recovery did not really improve their financial situations, and 66 percent said their incomes fell short of their expectations, the survey also found. For two years, Lian Si, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Chinese and Global Affairs of Peking University, who has studied the phenomenon, led a team of more than 100 graduate students to follow the groups in university towns like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Xi'an. Lian evaluates the total population of the "ant community" in major cities at one million across China, with about 100,000 found in Beijing alone. Lian predicts that an increasingly challenging job market will see the ant tribe growing further in number. Another 6.3 million graduates are expected to join migrant workers and other job hunters in what promises to be a fierce labour competition. The ant tribe's embarrassing living situations have become a serious social issue, and the government should develop "second-and-third-tier cities" to attract more graduates from big cities. However, "ants" expect more study and training opportunities in big cities, which keeps them in positive mindsets despite their situations. As in the case of Yang, he is optimistic about getting a new job soon, having received eight interview offers in a week after sending out his resume. The prospect of landing a higher-paying job keeps him hopeful of moving out of the slum district  soon. The sooner the better. . The passage is mainly about    _   .

Query 83: Monday, April 17 Dear Gramps, I was so upset last week when somebody stole my Super Racer from the park by your house. I called up the toy company but they said they have only red, blue and green racers. Dad called Cobb's Toy Store today and found out they might have purple ones. Can we go there when I come to visit you next week?You and I were only gone for a few minutes to the shop down the street to get ice-cream and cookies. Maybe the thief was watching us. Mum was surprised when I told her the racer was stolen. She said she used to leave things at the park all the time when she was young. Once she even left her bicycle for two days near the swimming pool. Tell Grandma that I like the food she made last time. Ask Grandma if we can have pancakes with sugar for breakfast when I come this time. I have packed in my towel, comb and soap. Tell her this time I won't forget to pack in my toothbrush.

The writer is upset because their Super Racer was stolen and they are looking for a purple one. The writer's dad found out that Cobb's Toy Store might have purple racers. Therefore, the writer wants a purple racer.

The correct answer is D.

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided in the letter.

The writer mentions that the toy company has only red, blue, and green racers, but then states that Cobb's Toy Store might have purple ones. This suggests that the writer is interested in a purple Super Racer, as it is the only color not mentioned as being available from the toy company.

The writer's desire to visit Cobb's Toy Store to look for a purple Super Racer is also a strong indication of their preference for this color.

Therefore, the correct answer is the one that matches the color the writer is interested in.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The correct answer is D. The letter indicates that Toby's Super Racer was stolen, and while the original toy company only offers red, blue, and green, his father discovered purple racers at Cobb's Toy Store. Toby explicitly asks to visit Cobb's to obtain a purple racer, making it clear he wants the purple color.

All answer choices:
1. A) shape of earlobes
2. B) musical ability
3. C) personality
4. D) language


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is A) shape of earlobes.

The correct answer is A

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
To determine which trait children most likely inherit from their parents, we need to consider the nature of inheritance in genetics.

A) Shape of earlobes: Earlobe shape is influenced by genetics, but it is not the most significant trait that children inherit from their parents.

B) Musical ability: While there is some evidence that musical ability can be inherited, it is not the most dominant trait that children inherit from their parents.

C) Personality: Personality is influenced by both genetics and environment, making it a complex trait to attribute solely to inheritance.

D) Language: Language is a complex trait that is primarily learned through environment and upbringing, not inherited from parents.

The correct answer is C) personality.

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze each option carefully.

A) Shape of earlobes: Research has shown that the shape of earlobes is a trait that can be inherited from parents. Studies have found that the shape of earlobes is determined by a single gene, and people tend to inherit their earlobe shape from their parents.

B) Musical ability: While there is some evidence to suggest that musical ability may have a genetic component, it is a complex trait that is influenced by multiple factors, including environmental and cultural factors. It is not a trait that is solely inherited from parents.

C) Personality: Personality is a complex trait that is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While there may be some genetic predispositions to certain personality traits, it is not a trait that is directly inherited from parents in the same way that physical characteristics are.

D) Language: Language is a complex trait that is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While there may be some genetic predispositions to language development, it is not a trait that is directly inherited from parents in the same way that physical characteristics are.

Based on the analysis of each option, the trait that children most likely inherit from their parents is the shape of earlobes.

The correct answer is A

minister3:
The question asks which trait is most likely inherited from parents. Inheritance typically refers to genetic traits passed through DNA. Earlobe shape (A) is a well-documented genetic trait determined by a single gene, making it directly inheritable. Musical ability (B) and personality (C) are influenced by both genetics and environmental factors, while language (D) is primarily learned through exposure. Among the options, earlobe shape is the most straightforward genetic inheritance. The correct answer is A.

All answer choices:
1. A) eggs
2. B) feathers
3. C) feet
4. D) wings


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is C

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the primary functions of a bird's beak. Birds use their beaks for various purposes such as eating, preening, and sometimes for defense. However, the options provided are not directly related to these functions.

- A) eggs: Birds do not use their beaks for the same purpose as their eggs. Eggs are laid by female birds and are not used by the bird itself.
- B) feathers: Feathers are used for flight, insulation, and display, but not for the same purpose as the beak.
- C) feet: Feet are used for walking, perching, and sometimes for grasping objects, but not for the same purpose as the beak.
- D) wings: Wings are used for flight, but not for the same purpose as the beak.

Given the options, none of them directly relate to the primary functions of a bird's beak. However, the question seems to be asking for a comparison that is not directly related to the beak's functions. Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that the question is asking for a part of the bird that is used for a purpose similar to the beak, but not the beak itself.

The correct answer is D) wings, as wings are used for flight, which is a primary function that birds share with their beaks in terms of movement and action.

The correct answer is D

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the question and options:

The question asks about the purpose of a bird's beak. Beaks are a distinctive feature of birds, and they serve a specific function.

Option A, "eggs," is incorrect because eggs are a reproductive structure produced by female birds, not a purpose of the beak.

Option B, "feathers," is also incorrect because feathers are a covering on a bird's body, providing insulation, support, and protection, but they are not a purpose of the beak.

Option C, "feet," is incorrect because feet are used for perching, grasping, and walking, but they are not related to the function of the beak.

Option D, "wings," is also incorrect because wings are used for flying, but they are not related to the function of the beak.

However, the beak is used for eating, preening, and other functions. The beak is a versatile tool that can be used for various purposes, including tearing flesh, cracking open seeds, and picking up food. In many cases, the beak serves a similar purpose to the feet, as both are used for manipulating objects.

The correct answer is C

Query 86: We have known for a long time that flowers of different plants open and close at different time of day. Yet no one really understands why flowers open and close like this at particular times. It is not as simple as we might think, as new experiments have shown. In one experiment, flowers were kept in darkness. We might expect that the flowers, without any information about the time of the day, did not open as they usually do. In fact, they continued to open at their usual time. This shows that they have some mysterious   way of knowing the time. Their sense of time does not depend on information from the outside world; it is, so to speak, inside them, a kind of "inner clock". This discovery may not seem to be very important. However, it was later found that not just plants but also animals including man have this "inner clock"which controls working of their bodies and their activities. Human beings, then, are also controlled by this mysterious power. Whether we wish it or not, it affects such things in our life as our need for sleep, our need for food. And our ability to concentrate . That flowers have the sense of time is related to  _  .
A) sunlight
B) weak light
C) the "inner clock"
D) the information from the outside world


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: C) the "inner clock"

All answer choices:
1. A) sunlight
2. B) weak light
3. C) the "inner clock"
4. D) the information from the outside world


collaborative Response:
The phenomenon of flowers opening and closing at specific times of the day is indeed fascinating and regulated by an internal mechanism known as the circadian clock. This internal clock allows plants to synchronize their biological processes with the external environment, even when isolated from external cues such as sunlight. The experiment where flowers were kept in darkness still opened at their usual time demonstrates that their timing is controlled by an internal mechanism rather than external information.

While Minister 1 correctly identifies this as a circadian clock, it's important to note that the exact mechanisms and interactions with external factors are more complex than initially thought. The circadian clock is influenced by various environmental cues, including light, temperature, and possibly others, and these interactions can vary across different species. This suggests that the "inner clock" is not a universal phenomenon but rather an adaptive mechanism that has evolved differently in various organisms.

Minister 2 highlights that the experiments do not directly prove that the clock is responsible for the flowers' daily rhythms but instead suggest the presence of an internal timing mechanism. Additionally, the relationship between the "inner clock" and human behavior is not as straightforward. While humans have circadian rhythms that regulate activities like sleep and metabolism, the mechanisms and interactions are more complex and influenced by both internal and external factors.

Minister 3's focus on the practical implications is valuable. Understanding the circadian clock in both plants and humans can lead to significant advancements in agriculture and health. For example, optimizing crop yields by aligning planting and harvesting times with the circadian rhythms of plants can enhance productivity. In humans, understanding how the circadian clock affects sleep, mood, and productivity can improve health outcomes and work performance.

In conclusion, the "inner clock" is a crucial biological mechanism that plays a role in regulating the daily rhythms of both plants and animals, including humans. While the exact mechanisms and interactions are complex and not fully understood, the discovery underscores the importance of circadian rhythms in maintaining biological harmony and health.

The correct answer is C) the "inner clock".

The correct answer is C

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The passage discusses the discovery that plants, including flowers, have an "inner clock" that regulates their opening and closing times, independent of external information. This "inner clock" is also found in animals, including humans, and affects various biological processes such as sleep, food intake, and concentration.

The question asks what the passage is related to. The passage is related to the concept of an "inner clock" that regulates biological processes, which is option C.

The correct answer is C.

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the text carefully.

The text describes an experiment where flowers were kept in darkness, and yet they still opened at their usual time. This suggests that the flowers have an internal mechanism that allows them to keep track of time, independent of external cues such as sunlight or information from the outside world.

The text then goes on to explain that this "inner clock" is not unique to plants, but is also found in animals, including humans. This inner clock controls various bodily functions and activities, such as sleep, eating, and concentration.

Now, let's look at the options:

A) Sunlight: The text actually suggests that the flowers continued to open at their usual time even in darkness, which implies that sunlight is not the reason for their internal clock.

B) Weak light: The text does not mention weak light as a factor in the flowers' internal clock.

C) The "inner clock": This option is consistent with the text, which describes the flowers' ability to keep track of time as an internal mechanism, or "inner clock".

D) The information from the outside world: The text actually suggests that the flowers' internal clock is independent of external information, so this option is not correct.

The correct answer is C

minister3:
The passage explains that flowers open and close at specific times even when kept in darkness, indicating they do not rely on external light cues. Instead, it emphasizes that their timing is governed by an "inner clock" inherent to them. The experiment rules out dependence on external information (like sunlight or weak light), as the flowers maintained their usual behavior without these stimuli. The discovery of this internal timekeeping mechanism is central to the discussion. 

The correct answer is C

president:
The correct answer is C) the "inner clock".

Query 87: Grandpa Nybakken loved life -- especially when he could play a trick on somebody. At those times, his large Norwegian frame shook with laughter while he pretended innocent surprise, exclaiming, "Oh, forevermore!" But on a cold Saturday in downtown Chicago, Grandpa felt that God played a trick on him, and grandpa wasn't laughing. Grandpa worked as a carpenter. On this particular day, he was building some boxes for the clothes his church was sending to an orphanage abroad. On his way home, he reached into his shirt pocket to find his glasses, but they were gone. He remembered putting them there that morning, so he drove back to the church. His search proved fruitless. Suddenly, he realized what had happened. The glasses had slipped out of his pocket unnoticed and fallen into one of the boxes, which he had nailed shut. His brand new glasses were heading for China! The Great Depression was at its height, and Grandpa had six children. He had spent twenty dollars for those glasses that very morning. "It's not fair," he told God as he drove home in frustration. "I've been very faithful in giving of my time and money to your work, and now this." Several months later, the director of the orphanage was on vacation in the United States.He wanted to visit all the churches that supported him, so he came to speak on Sunday night at my grandfather's small church in Chicago. Grandpa and his family sat in their usual seats among the small congregation  . "But most of all," he said, "I must thank you for the glasses you sent last year." "Even if I had the money, there was simply no way of replacing those glasses.Along with not being able to see well, I experienced headaches every day, so my co-workers and I were much in prayer about this. Then your boxes arrived.When my staff removed the covers, they found a pair of glasses lying on the top." After a long pause, he continued, "Folks, when I tried on the glasses, it was as though they had been custom-made just for me! I want to thank you for being a part of that!" The people listened, happy for the amazing glasses. But the director surely must have confused their church with another, they thought, there were no glasses on their list of items to be sent overseas. But sitting quietly in the back, with tears streaming down his face, an ordinary carpenter realized _ had used him in an extraordinary way. The people in the church but Grandpa felt confused at what the director said because   _  .
A) Grandpa didn't tell the director that he was the owner of the glasses
B) the director wanted to return the glasses even though he liked it
C) the director could not get such glasses in their own country

The correct answer is A.

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the situation and the options provided.

The story tells us that Grandpa had donated a box of clothes to an orphanage abroad, and in the process, his glasses had accidentally fallen into the box and were shipped to the orphanage. The director of the orphanage later visits Grandpa's church and expresses gratitude for the glasses that were sent, saying they were a blessing to him and his staff.

The question asks why the people in the church, but Grandpa, felt confused at what the director said. The correct answer should explain why the people in the church were surprised or confused, but not Grandpa.

Let's evaluate the options:

A) Grandpa didn't tell the director that he was the owner of the glasses - This option doesn't explain why the people in the church were confused. The director's gratitude is directed at the church, not Grandpa personally.

B) The director wanted to return the glasses even though he liked them - This option is not supported by the text. The director is grateful for the glasses and wants to thank the church for them.

C) The director could not get such glasses in their own country - This option is not relevant to the situation. The director is expressing gratitude for the glasses, not saying that they were hard to obtain.

D) The glasses were not included in the donation list - This option is the most plausible explanation. The people in the church thought that the glasses were not part of the donation, which is why they were confused when the director thanked them for the glasses.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The story describes Grandpa Nybakken accidentally sending his own glasses to an orphanage in China when they fell into a box he sealed. When the orphanage director later thanked the church for the glasses, the congregation was surprised because they had not included glasses in their donation list. This confusion stemmed from the director's assumption that the church had intentionally sent the glasses, which contradicted the church's actual contributions. Grandpa, however, realized that God had used his accidental act as a means to provide the glasses, which were not part of the church's planned donations.

Query 88: The expression "a thirst for knowledge" may soon have a new meaning for millions of people who have no way to get clean water. Researchers have developed a book with specially treated pages that can turn dirty water into clean and drinkable water. They say their invention could improve the lives of many in the developing world. About 700 million people around the world are at risk of disease or even death because their drinking water is not clean. The water is polluted by harmful bacteria. The book contains 25 pages. Each page is about one millimeter thick. The pages contain very small particles   of silver. The pages can be used as filters to remove harmful microorganisms   that can pollute drinking water. The filter kills the organisms that pass through it. Pictures on the pages show the dangers of dirty water and how to use the book for those unable to read. The pages are made of filter paper. They are designed to be torn from the book. Water can be poured through the paper to be cleaned. Ms. Dankovich, the inventor, says each page can treat up to 100 liters of water. She recently presented her invention at the meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston, Massachusetts. She was asked whether she had considered adding classic literature on the book's pages. "The idea of classic texts--that's of interest maybe later. We have discussed a little bit more exciting text. But we really haven't had the time to go through _ " she says. Teri Dankovich and another researcher tested the drinkable book in Bangladesh, Ghana and South Africa. The tests proved to be successful. Water for Life, a non-governmental organization, has provided financial support for the project. What is the main idea of the passage?
A) Researchers have found a way to save those being ill.
B) Millions of people are in great need of drinkable water.

minister2:
To determine the main idea of the passage, let's analyze each option carefully:

A) Researchers have found a way to save those being ill. - While the passage mentions that the invention could improve the lives of many in the developing world, it doesn't specifically state that the researchers have found a way to save those being ill. The focus is more on providing clean drinking water.

B) Millions of people are in great need of drinkable water. - This option is partially correct, as the passage does mention that about 700 million people around the world are at risk of disease or even death because their drinking water is not clean. However, it's not the main idea of the passage.

C) Book pages could provide safe drinking water. - This option accurately summarizes the main idea of the passage. The researchers have developed a book with specially treated pages that can turn dirty water into clean and drinkable water.

D) Knowledge is as important as drinkable water. - The passage mentions "a thirst for knowledge," but it's not the main idea of the passage. The focus is on the invention that can provide clean drinking water, not the importance of knowledge.

The correct answer is C

minister3:
The passage primarily discusses a novel invention—a book with specially treated pages that can purify dirty water into clean, drinkable water. It highlights the problem of water pollution affecting millions, introduces the solution (the "drinkable book"), explains its mechanism (silver particles as filters), and mentions successful testing and support from an organization. While the problem of water scarcity is noted (Option B), the focus is on the innovation and its potential to address the issue. Option A is too narrow, as the invention is about water purification, not just saving the ill. Option D misinterprets the metaphorical use of "thirst for knowledge" as a literal comparison. The central theme is the use of book pages as a practical tool for providing safe drinking water.

Query 89: As has been all too apparent in recent days at Balcombe, few issues cause greater concern than energy policy. Many village communities feel their countryside is being ruined by the power-producing machines of wind farms; yet they never take "direct action", even though the planning laws put them at a severe disadvantage. And the generous subsidies   , which encourage the expansion of wind power, are not favorable to the village communities and set landowners in conflict with other residents   . Those who disagree with the rapid expansion of wind farms state that the damage they cause is out of proportion  to the benefits they bring, because their energy output cannot match that of the carbon-based power stations they are supposed to replace. Supporters insist that wind must be part of a mix of renewables, nuclear and carbon, and that the country is committed to meeting EU ( European Union) targets for non-carbon energy generation. ZXXK Against this background, the fact that there is an argument within the Government over whether to publish an official report on wind farms' impact on the countryside becomes even more extraordinary. The two parties in the coalition   government are in disagreement over what it should say. We have some advice for the two parties: publish the report, and let the country be the judge.  Even if it contains evidence that wind farms are harmful, it will hardly be a pleasant surprise to people who do not like them. Equally, supporters must argue their case by acknowledging the concerns and explaining why they are either misplaced or worthy of much attention. The suggestion that further negotiations are to take place to produce an "acceptable" report suggests that the politics of coalition government are doing the country harm in a certain way. Given the sensitivities involved, all the information should be available so that people can reach their own conclusions, rather than being left with the suspicion that facts are being replaced by political beliefs. Supporters think that the expansion of wind power  _  .
A) is more rapid than that of carbon-based power
B) guarantees an increase in energy output

Query 90: Way of Life for Students The Internet is way of life for US college students, with research showing them to be one of the most connected groups. A recent study by Harris Interactive and 360 Youth found that 93 percent of American college students visit the Internet, and this market is expected to grow from 15.2 million in 2003 to 16.4 million in 2007. That is slow but could be the result of the already high number of college Internet users. About 88 percent of American college students own a computer, and more than half have broadband connections. Furthermore, 67 percent own cell phones and 36 percent use their mobile devices to visit the Internet. Study findings are that 42 percent go online mainly to communicate socially, and 72 percent of college students check emails at least once a day, with 66 percent using at least two email addresses. The most popular online social activity is forwarding messages to friends or family, with 37 percent of college students saying they do so. The study also looked beyond the Internet surfing habits and into the buying habits of this group, and found them responsible for more than US $ 210 billion in sales last year alone. College students have learned how to spend their money, with 93 percent saying low prices were important when shopping. The study also showed that 65 percent make loan payments; 41 percent of freshmen have a credit card; and 79 percent of seniors have a credit card. A significant number of charges on these credit cards are likely to be for entertainment and leisure expenses. To communicate with friends, nearly half of the college students use  _  .

Query 91: They may have text,email,Facebook and Twitter,but young people are still lonelier than any other age group.The Loneliness in New Zealand Report,published by Statistics New Zealand,shows under 30s are more likely to feel lonely than older people because loneliness decreases with age.Loneliness and poor mental health were strongly related across all ages.Young people were not as likely to feel lonely because of financial hardship,but among older people,lack of money was a significant influence on loneliness.Women were more likely to feel lonely than men. Philip Walker,spokesman for the General Social Survey,said because it was  ly new it was hard to know whether loneliness among young people was a new trend.But overseas research has found that levels of loneliness in youth today are growing. Mr.Walker said the finding needed more exploration,including looking at the role of technology and social media."It could be that people's expectations of connection have gone up,so we expect increased levels of connection,"he said."While technology like cell phones could help young people stay connected,on the other hand for those who do get bullied ,especially bullied online,it's quite isolating.A lot of the time potentially it is a big contributor to loneliness." Figures from online dating website FindSomeone also confirmed more young people were looking for love.Manager Rick Davies,said younger dating hopefuls were the fastest growing group on the site. Mr.Davies noted that since the report data was collected in 2010there had been huge growth in smart phones,which meant people were online even more.He believed online tools,such as Skype,could help people stay connected."People can keep in touch with a wide range of friends from all over the world much more easily now.It's like you're sitting in your living room having a chat with them." Bemardine Reid,operations committee chairwoman for Samaritans,which operates a free helpline,said many of their calls came from people who were lonely."It might be that they've got some problem,just like all the things people would normally talk to a friend about,but people who are alone lack those normal contacts." The Statistics New Zealand report also showed people who didn't have face-to-face contact with family and friends were more likely to feel lonely,as were those who lived alone. It can be inferred from the passage that  .

minister1:
The passage discusses the findings of the Loneliness in New Zealand Report, which highlights the increasing levels of loneliness among young people. It mentions that technology and social media play a significant role in both connecting and isolating individuals. The report also notes that lack of face-to-face contact and living alone contribute to feelings of loneliness.

Let's analyze the options:

A) FindSomeone is a website where you can find old friends - This option is not supported by the passage. The passage mentions FindSomeone as an online dating website, not a platform for finding old friends.

B) without technology, young people would not feel lonely - This option is not supported by the passage. The passage does not discuss the impact of technology on loneliness among young people in a way that suggests it would not exist without technology.

C) high technology results in the older being lonely - This option is not supported by the passage. The passage discusses the impact of technology on loneliness among young people, not older people.

D) those cheated or hurt online tend to feel lonely - This option is supported by the passage. The passage mentions that online bullying can be isolating and contribute to loneliness.

Therefore, the correct answer is D) those cheated or hurt online tend to feel lonely.

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the passage carefully.

The passage discusses the issue of loneliness among young people in New Zealand, citing a report by Statistics New Zealand. It highlights that young people, particularly those under 30, are more likely to feel lonely than older people. The report also notes that loneliness is strongly related to poor mental health across all ages.

Regarding technology, the passage mentions that while it can help people stay connected, it can also be a contributor to loneliness, particularly for those who experience online bullying. The passage also notes that online tools, such as Skype, can help people stay connected with friends and family.

Now, let's examine the options:

A) FindSomeone is a website where you can find old friends: This is not mentioned in the passage. The passage actually states that FindSomeone is an online dating website where younger people are the fastest-growing group.

B) Without technology, young people would not feel lonely: This is not supported by the passage. The passage actually suggests that technology can be both a help and a hindrance to connection and loneliness.

C) High technology results in the older being lonely: This is not mentioned in the passage. The passage actually discusses the issue of loneliness among young people, not older people.

D) Those cheated or hurt online tend to feel lonely: This is a possible inference from the passage. The passage mentions that online bullying can be a contributor to loneliness, and it quotes Rick Davies as saying that online tools can be isolating for those who experience bullying.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The passage discusses factors contributing to loneliness among different age groups in New Zealand. It mentions that young people are more likely to feel lonely despite having access to technology like text, email, and social media. However, it also highlights that online bullying can isolate individuals and contribute to loneliness. While the text does not explicitly state that being "cheated or hurt online" leads to loneliness, it does connect online bullying (a form of being hurt online) to increased feelings of loneliness. 

Option A is incorrect because the passage refers to FindSomeone as a dating website, not specifically for finding old friends.  
Option B is incorrect because the passage does not claim technology prevents loneliness; instead, it notes both its potential to connect and its role in exacerbating loneliness through bullying.  
Option C is incorrect because the report attributes loneliness in older people to financial hardship, not necessarily high technology.  
Option D is supported by the passage's mention of online bullying as a significant contributor to loneliness, making it the most reasonable inference.  

The correct answer is D

Query 92: When families gather for Christmas dinner, some will stick to formal traditions dating back to grandma's generation. Their tables will be set with the good dishes and silver, and the dress code will be Sunday best. But in many other homes, this china-and-silver elegance has given way to a stoneware   and stainless informality, with dresses assuming an equally casual-Friday look. For hosts and guests, the change means greater simplicity and comfort. For makers of fine china in Britain, it spells economic hard times. Last week _ , the largest employer in Stoke-on-Trent, announced that it is eliminating 1,000 jobs -- one-fifth of its total workforce. That brings to more than 4, 000 the number of positions lost in 18 months in the pottery   region. Wedgwood and other pottery factories made cuts earlier. Although a strong pound and weak markets in Asia play a role in the downsizing, the layoffs in Stoke have their roots in earthshaking social shifts. A spokesman for Royal Doulton admitted that the company "has been somewhat slow in catching up with the trend" toward casual dining. Families eat together less often, he explained, and more people eat alone, either because they are single or they eat in front of television. Even dinner parties, if they happen at all, have gone casual. In a time of long work hours and demanding family schedules, busy hosts insist, rightly, that it's better to share a takeout pizza on paper plates in the family room than to wait for the perfect moment or a "real" dinner party. Too often, the perfect moment never comes. Iron a fine-patterned tablecloth? Forget it. Polish the silver? Who has time? Yet the loss of formality has its down side. The fine points of etiquette   that children might once have learned at the table by observation or instruction from parents and grandparents (" Chew with your mouth closed." "Keep your elbows off the table. ") must be picked up else-where. Some companies now offer etiquette seminars for employees who may be able professionally but inexperienced socially. It can be learned from the passage that 'Royal Doulton is  _  .

The correct answer is D

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The passage discusses the impact of changing dining habits on the pottery industry, specifically mentioning Royal Doulton. Royal Doulton is described as a company that has been slow to adapt to the trend towards casual dining, which has led to economic hard times for the company. The passage also mentions that Royal Doulton is a producer of fine china.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
D) a producer of fine china

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the passage and options carefully.

The passage discusses the decline of formal dining and its impact on the pottery industry, specifically mentioning Wedgwood and Royal Doulton as examples of companies that have been affected. The passage states that Royal Doulton has been slow to adapt to the trend towards casual dining and has had to make layoffs due to the decline in demand for fine china.

Option A, "a seller of stainless steel tableware," is incorrect because the passage does not mention stainless steel tableware as a product associated with Royal Doulton.

Option B, "a dealer in stoneware," is also incorrect because the passage mentions stoneware as an alternative to fine china, but does not indicate that Royal Doulton is a dealer in stoneware.

Option C, "a pottery chain store," is incorrect because the passage does not describe Royal Doulton as a retail store, but rather as a manufacturer of fine china.

Option D, "a producer of fine china," is the correct answer because the passage explicitly states that Royal Doulton is a company that makes fine china and has been affected by the decline in demand for this type of product.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The passage discusses the decline in demand for fine china due to shifting dining habits toward informality, such as using stoneware and stainless steel. Royal Doulton is explicitly mentioned as a company in the pottery region of Stoke-on-Trent that has been slow to adapt to these casual trends. This places Royal Doulton within the traditional fine china manufacturing sector, which is experiencing economic challenges. While the text references stoneware and stainless steel as newer alternatives, Royal Doulton's role is tied to the decline of formal dining practices, not the rise of these materials. The term "pottery region" and the context of layoffs in the industry further confirm that Royal Doulton is part of the fine china production chain. 

The correct answer is D

Query 93: A driver stopped his car on a street side to have a rest. When he sat in the seat and closed his eyes, a pedestrian   came up and knocked at his window to ask the time. The driver opened his eyes and looked at his watch, "It is 8 o'clock." He said. Then he went to sleep again. But soon he woke up because a second pedestrian was knocking at the window, "Sir, do you have the time?" he asked. The driver looked at his watch again and told the man it was 8:30. If it happened again, he could not have a good rest. So he wrote a short note and put it on the window for all the people to see. It said, " _ " Again the man sat in the seat and slept. A few minutes later a third pedestrian came along and began knocking at the window. "Hey, sir," she said, "It's 8:45." The driver stopped his car to   _  .
A) have breakfast
B) have a rest
C) have lunch
D) tell time


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: B) have a rest

All answer choices:
1. A) have breakfast
2. B) have a rest
3. C) have lunch
4. D) tell time


collaborative Response:
The driver was trying to rest but was interrupted multiple times by pedestrians asking for the time. After two interruptions, he wrote a note stating the time was 8:30 to avoid further disturbances. However, when a third pedestrian informed him it was 8:45, he checked his watch again, indicating he wanted to verify the time accurately. This suggests he was confused by the discrepancy between his note and the pedestrian's statement, prompting him to check his watch again. Therefore, the most logical action he would take is to tell the time again.

The correct answer is D) tell time.

The correct answer is D

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The driver was initially trying to rest but was repeatedly interrupted by pedestrians asking for the time. To avoid this, he wrote a note on the window saying "It is 8:30." This note was meant to inform anyone who asked that the time was 8:30, so they would not disturb him again. However, when a third pedestrian came along and said it was 8:45, the driver would likely be confused and wonder why the time had changed. Therefore, the driver would stop his car to check the time and ensure the note was accurate.

The correct answer is D) tell time.

minister2:
Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The driver initially tells the first pedestrian that it is 8 o'clock.
2. He then tells the second pedestrian that it is 8:30.
3. The driver writes a note and puts it on the window.
4. The third pedestrian reads the note and tells the driver that it is 8:45.

Given that the driver is trying to avoid telling the time to pedestrians, the note on the window is likely to indicate that he is not willing or able to tell the time. The note says "_ ", which is likely a polite way of saying "I'm not telling you the time." However, since the third pedestrian still manages to tell the driver the time, it's likely that the note is not a direct statement about the time.

Considering the context, the note is probably a humorous or sarcastic way of saying "I'm not telling you the time." A possible completion of the note could be "I'm not telling you the time." However, since that's not an option, we can look for a more fitting completion.

Given the situation, the driver stops his car to have a rest, as indicated by the initial situation. The note on the window is likely a way to avoid telling the time, but it doesn't change the fact that the driver was trying to rest.

The correct answer is B) have a rest.

minister3:
The driver initially stopped his car to rest, as explicitly stated in the first sentence of the story. The subsequent events involve pedestrians asking for the time, which he provides, but the reason for stopping the car remains his need to rest. The note he writes is a solution to avoid further interruptions, not the reason for stopping. None of the other options (breakfast, lunch, tell time) align with the stated purpose. 

The correct answer is B

Query 94: Why is protein an important part of a healthy diet?
A) It is needed to change glucose to energy.
B) It is needed to store nutrients.
C) It is needed to repair tissue.
D) It is needed to produce water.


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: C) It is needed to repair tissue.

All answer choices:
1. A) It is needed to change glucose to energy.
2. B) It is needed to store nutrients.
3. C) It is needed to repair tissue.
4. D) It is needed to produce water.


collaborative Response:
The correct answer is C. Protein is essential for a healthy diet primarily because it is needed to repair tissue. It provides the necessary amino acids to rebuild and maintain muscles, skin, organs, and other bodily structures, which is a crucial function highlighted by all three ministers. While protein also plays roles in producing enzymes and hormones, its primary role in tissue repair makes option C the most accurate answer.

The correct answer is C

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
Protein is an essential macronutrient that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions. Let's analyze each option:

A) It is needed to change glucose to energy.
- This statement is incorrect. Glucose is converted to energy through a process called glycolysis, not protein.

B) It is needed to store nutrients.
- This statement is incorrect. Protein is not primarily used for storing nutrients. Instead, it is used for structural purposes and various bodily functions.

C) It is needed to repair tissue.
- This statement is correct. Protein is essential for the repair and maintenance of tissues in the body, including muscles, skin, and organs.

D) It is needed to produce water.
- This statement is incorrect. Protein does not play a role in the production of water.

The correct answer is C) It is needed to repair tissue.

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to the importance of protein in a healthy diet.

Option A: "It is needed to change glucose to energy." This statement is incorrect because glucose is converted to energy through a process called cellular respiration, which involves the breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen. Protein is not directly involved in this process.

Option B: "It is needed to store nutrients." This statement is also incorrect because proteins are not primarily used for storing nutrients. Carbohydrates, such as glycogen, are used for short-term energy storage, while fats are used for long-term energy storage.

Option C: "It is needed to repair tissue." This statement is correct because proteins play a crucial role in the repair and maintenance of tissues in the body. They are used to build and repair muscles, bones, skin, and other tissues.

Option D: "It is needed to produce water." This statement is incorrect because proteins are not directly involved in the production of water. Water is produced through various metabolic processes, such as cellular respiration and the breakdown of nutrients.

The correct answer is C

minister3:
Protein is essential for the body's growth, maintenance, and repair of tissues. It provides amino acids, which are the building blocks for muscles, skin, organs, and other tissues. While proteins can be used for energy in certain cases, their primary role is not related to converting glucose to energy (A), storing nutrients (B), or producing water (D). The correct answer is C. 

The correct answer is C

Query 95: Which natural event can dry out plants and cause wildfires?
A) drought
B) earthquake
C) flood
D) tornado


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: A) drought

All answer choices:
1. A) drought
2. B) earthquake
3. C) flood
4. D) tornado


collaborative Response:
The natural event that can dry out plants and cause wildfires is drought. Droughts are characterized by prolonged periods of abnormally low rainfall, which directly lead to plant dryness and increased susceptibility to wildfires. While other natural events like earthquakes, floods, and tornadoes can have indirect effects on plant dryness, they do not directly cause the same level of dryness as droughts. Therefore, the most definitive answer is drought.

The correct answer is A

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
To determine which natural event can dry out plants and cause wildfires, let's analyze each option:

A) **Drought**: A drought is a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to water scarcity. This can cause plants to dry out, making them more susceptible to wildfires.

B) **Earthquake**: An earthquake is a sudden shaking of the Earth's surface due to the release of energy in the Earth's crust. While earthquakes can cause significant damage and destruction, they do not directly cause plants to dry out or start wildfires.

C) **Flood**: A flood is an overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods can cause significant damage but do not dry out plants or cause wildfires.

D) **Tornado**: A tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud. Tornadoes can cause significant damage but do not directly dry out plants or cause wildfires.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is A

minister2:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to the question:

1. Drought: A drought is a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, which can lead to dry soil and plants. This condition can create an environment conducive to wildfires, as dry vegetation is more susceptible to burning.

2. Earthquake: While earthquakes can cause significant damage to the environment, they are not typically associated with drying out plants or causing wildfires directly. Earthquakes can, however, trigger landslides or soil liquefaction, which can indirectly contribute to wildfires.

3. Flood: A flood is an overflow of water that can damage plants and disrupt ecosystems. However, flooding is not typically associated with drying out plants or causing wildfires. In fact, flooding can sometimes help to extinguish wildfires by providing a layer of water over the affected area.

4. Tornado: A tornado is a rotating column of air that can cause significant damage to plants and structures. However, tornadoes are not typically associated with drying out plants or causing wildfires. Tornadoes can, however, create conditions that lead to wildfires, such as by knocking over power lines or igniting debris.

Considering the options, drought is the most directly related to drying out plants and causing wildfires.

The correct answer is A

minister3:
Drought is a natural event characterized by a prolonged period of insufficient rainfall, leading to reduced soil moisture and water stress in plants. This dryness increases the flammability of vegetation, making it more susceptible to ignition from sources such as lightning, human activities, or other sparks. Earthquakes (B) primarily cause ground shaking and structural damage, not plant desiccation. Floods (C) introduce excess water, which would moisten rather than dry out plants. Tornadoes (D) are severe windstorms that can damage plants but do not inherently cause them to dry. Therefore, drought is the only option directly linked to drying plants and creating conditions conducive to wildfires. 

The correct answer is A

president:
The correct answer is A) drought.

Query 96: Restaurants in Europe, the United States and Japan are testing technology to let diners order their food direct from a screen at their table instead of depending on a fellow human being to note their choice. Besides cutting costs, companies that sell the "e-menus" argue the bytes-for-bites way has a new value that can attract younger customers, and various photographs of steaks and gooey desserts attract diners to order more. It also could extend the TV dinner. How about a computer game dinner? "It's about _ ," said Adi Chitayat, Conceptic's CEO. "If a person starts looking at pictures of chocolate cake, the chances are he'll order it." Frame, a restaurant in Tel Aviv with the system, is said to have its sales on tables with the e-menu increased by about 11% . Customers often call ahead to reserve  spots equipped with screens, manager Natalie Edry told Reporters. At one of the e-menu tables, IT worker Gil Uriel and his young family were enthusiastic as they checked out pictures of the dishes on offer and squabbled overdesserts. "It's more visual," says Uriel, as his children clicked away furiously on a games function between courses. "We can still choose, we can still argue --but it's much easier when we can all see it."

Query 97: Rome-Doctors and medical groups around the world last weekend reacted with strong opposition to the news that an Italian specialist is _ cloning the first human baby.     DL Severino Antinod,who is the head of a hospital in Rome,has been referred to in an Arab newspaper as claiming that one of his patients is eight weeks pregnant with a cloned baby.     Antinori refused to comment on the reports,but in March 2001 he said he hoped to produce a cloned embryo for implantation within two years.So far seven different kinds of mammals have already successfully cloned,including sheep,cats and most recently rabbits. Doctors showed their doubt and were strongly opposed although they admit that human cloning would finally come true unless there was a world wide ban on the practice.        Professor Rudolf Jaenisch of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says,"I find it astonishing that people do this where the result can be foretold that it will not be a normal baby.It is using humans as guinea pigs.It makes people feel sick."But Ronald Green,director of the Ethics institute at Darmouth College in the US,said it is unlikely that an eight-week-old pregnancy would lead to a birth.     So far all cloned animals have suffered from some different serious disorders,many of them dying soon after their births.     Doctors are opposed to human cloning because they are worried about the welfare of the cloned child if there is one.     "There are no benefits of cloned human begins,just harm."said Dr.Michael Wilks of the UK. Which is the best title for the embryo?
A) The Success of Cloning Humans
B) The Anger at Cloning Humans
C) Failure of Cloning Humans
D) First Cloned Human


Reference Answer:
The correct answer is: D) First Cloned Human

All answer choices:
1. A) The Success of Cloning Humans
2. B) The Anger at Cloning Humans
3. C) Failure of Cloning Humans
4. D) First Cloned Human


collaborative Response:
The best title for the embryo is **B) The Anger at Cloning Humans**. This title accurately captures the central theme of the article, which is the strong opposition and ethical concerns raised by medical professionals and international groups regarding human cloning. While Minister 2 suggested considering broader implications, the article's focus remains on the negative reactions and moral objections, making "The Anger at Cloning Humans" the most appropriate choice.

The correct answer is B.

The correct answer is B

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The best title for the embryo is "First Cloned Human" because the article discusses the news that an Italian specialist claims to have cloned the first human baby. The other options do not accurately reflect the main topic of the article.

The correct answer is D) First Cloned Human

minister2:
To determine the best title for the embryo, we need to analyze the information provided in the text. The text mentions that an Italian specialist, Dr. Severino Antinori, is attempting to clone a human baby, and several doctors and medical groups are expressing strong opposition to this practice. The opposition is based on concerns about the welfare of the cloned child and the potential harm it may suffer.

Option A, "The Success of Cloning Humans," is not the best title because the text does not indicate that the cloning has been successful. In fact, the text mentions that all cloned animals have suffered from serious disorders and many have died soon after birth.

Option B, "The Anger at Cloning Humans," is not the best title because while the text does mention that doctors are expressing opposition to the practice, it does not specifically mention "anger."

Option C, "Failure of Cloning Humans," is not the best title because the text does not indicate that the cloning has failed. In fact, the text mentions that Dr. Antinori is attempting to clone a human baby, which suggests that the cloning may be successful.

Option D, "First Cloned Human," is the best title because the text specifically mentions that Dr. Antinori is attempting to clone the first human baby. This title accurately reflects the information provided in the text.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The article discusses the controversial claim by an Italian doctor, Dr. Severino Antinori, that a patient is eight weeks pregnant with a cloned human baby. While it highlights the widespread opposition from medical professionals and ethical concerns, the central focus is on the announcement of this potential first cloned human. The title should reflect the primary subject of the news, which is the claim of the first cloned human, even though the outcome remains uncertain and the practice is widely criticized. 

The correct answer is D

president:
The correct answer is C

Query 98: It's hard to imagine life without the Internet. How greatly it has changed our lives in the past 15 years since it was widely used. At the same time, however, the Internet has also caused some traditions to fall away  . E-mail is quicker and cheaper. Getting a handwritten letter from a friend has become a rare   pleasure. Who would like to pay 60 yuan for 12 songs in a plastic case if you can find music in the Internet for free?

Query 99: Yes, it's still 2015, but as USA Today says, "it's never too early to plan your 2016 travels". With so many hot destinations   around the globe, "where should I go?" can be difficult to answer. According to Lonely Planet, though, Brazil is a fine choice - on April 29, the travel guide named that country the top one to visit in 2016. "As if endless strands of coast and mountains splashed with rainforest didn't already add up to an unfair share of heaven  , Brazil held one of the greatest sporting events in the world, the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and the 2016 Summer Olympics, another greatest one, will be followed ," explained Lonely Planet. Brazil is the largest and most populous country in South America. It boasts   the Amazon, the world's largest jungle  , which is home to a variety of plants and animals. But the great landscape   is not the only thing Brazilians take pride in. The colors green and yellow might make most people think of Brazil's soccer team even more than its national flag. Soccer is more than a sport in Brazil; it's a way of life. In fact, the World Cup brings Brazilians together. It is interesting to note that the general elections   in Brazil are usually held during the same year as the World Cup. Political parties try to take advantage of the patriotic enthusiasm   created by soccer to inspire political energy. Alongside soccer, samba is another emblem   of Brazil. The country's most traditional dance is highlighted every February at the Rio Carnival, which is one of the world's biggest. "Brazil has left its second-class nation status  ," said former Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in 2009 after Rio de Janeiro was awarded the 2016 Olympics. Brazil's growing economy, fueled   by oil and aircraft factories, has made it more than just a nation of samba, soccer and beaches. These days, it might just be the best tourist destination in the world. The authors purpose in writing the article is to   _  .
A) explain why Brazil will be holding the two sporting events
B) give an introduction of Brazil as a tourist destination
C) give an objective review of Brazil as a nation
D) prove that Lonely Planets recommendation is right

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The purpose of the article is to introduce Brazil as a tourist destination and highlight its unique features, such as its natural beauty, cultural significance, and economic growth. The article mentions Brazil's hosting of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the upcoming 2016 Summer Olympics, but these are not the main focus.

The correct answer is B) give an introduction of Brazil as a tourist destination

minister2:
To determine the author's purpose in writing the article, let's analyze the content and structure of the text.

The article provides a general overview of Brazil as a country, highlighting its natural attractions, cultural events, and economic growth. The author mentions the country's natural beauty, including its coastlines, mountains, and rainforests, as well as its cultural icons, such as soccer and samba. The text also touches on Brazil's economic growth and its hosting of major sporting events, including the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.

The author's tone is informative and promotional, suggesting that Brazil is a great destination for tourists. The text includes statements from a former Brazilian president, which adds credibility to the article. However, the primary focus is on showcasing Brazil's attractions and qualities, rather than providing a neutral or objective review of the country.

Query 100: Can technology improve your trip? Meet Judy Williams. When she and her husband recently checked into Blu Hotel in Zurich, a clerk asked them to sign the dotted line on a room rate hundreds of dollars higher than their online offer. "It was not a cheap stay," says Williams, a lawyer from Billings, Mont. But it became more of one after her husband fired up the Booking.com app he'd used to book their room on his smart phone. "As soon as we showed him the cost, he honored it," Williams says. Technology may create challenges for travelers but it can also solve them. It's more than making sure of a hotel cost. The latest Booking.com can help users select hotels by location, make a secure booking and view the confirmed   cost so they never need to re-discuss their hotel price. Another pain point for travelers is traffic that eats away precious vacation time. There's a new app called Commute which is aimed at users who have to make the same trip every day. But if you're headed to Los Angeles or Honolulu, where visitors can easily get stuck in hours of heavy traffic, Commute can help. Just input basic information about your destination and expected leaving time, and the app will start sending you traffic information 15 minutes before you leave. Testing Commute proved to be a challenge for me, because my home address is about 900 miles from my place of work. But if you have only a short distance to travel through a heavily populated area, you can use Commute to avoid traffic jams. Another source of travel-related problems is money. That's particularly true when you're dealing with a foreign currency. The latest Travel Money Tracker helps travelers prevent currency mix-ups. It immediately changes a country's native currency to yours, so you know exactly how much that Espresso   in Milan costs in dollars. It can also warn you when you're overspending, which can sometimes be a problem when you're on vacation. The only catch, of course, is that you have to remember to record all your purchases. Taken together, these apps solve some of the most common travel problems. But not all of them. Some things, no smart phone can fix, which means I get to keep my job - for now at least. What does the writer want to tell through the example of Judy Williams?
A) The cost of Blu Hotel was higher than that of others.
B) The clerk was very friendly and patient.
C) The smart phones have many functions.
D) Technology can make our trips better.

The correct answer is D) Technology can make our trips better.

The correct answer is D

Individual Model Responses:

minister1:
The writer wants to tell through the example of Judy Williams that "Technology can make our trips better." The example illustrates how technology, specifically the Booking.com app, helped resolve a problem with the hotel room rate, and how other apps like Commute and Travel Money Tracker can address common travel issues such as traffic and currency exchange.

The correct answer is D.

minister2:
To answer this question, let's analyze the given information and options carefully.

The writer presents the example of Judy Williams to illustrate how technology can improve a trip. Judy Williams and her husband were initially quoted a higher room rate at the Blu Hotel in Zurich, but after her husband showed the clerk the lower cost on the Booking.com app, the clerk honored the original price. This example is used to demonstrate how technology can help travelers avoid potential problems, such as overpaying for a hotel room.

Now, let's examine the options:

A) The cost of Blu Hotel was higher than that of others. - This option is partially true, but it's not the main point the writer wants to convey through Judy Williams' example.

B) The clerk was very friendly and patient. - This option is not supported by the text. The clerk is actually portrayed as someone who initially tried to charge the Williams a higher rate.

C) The smart phones have many functions. - While this option is true, it's not the main point the writer wants to make through Judy Williams' example.

D) Technology can make our trips better. - This option aligns with the writer's overall message. The example of Judy Williams is used to illustrate how technology can help travelers avoid potential problems and make their trips better.

The correct answer is D

minister3:
The example of Judy Williams illustrates how technology, specifically the Booking.com app, resolved a specific travel issue (unexpectedly high hotel rates) by providing transparency and ensuring the correct price was honored. The writer then expands on this by discussing other technologies that address different travel challenges, such as traffic and currency conversion. This progression emphasizes the broader role of technology in improving travel experiences by solving common problems. While the other options touch on details or tangential aspects, they do not capture the central message of the example. The correct answer is D. 

The correct answer is D

president:
The writer wants to show that technology can improve travel experiences by solving common issues like expensive hotel rates, traffic, and financial management. The example of Judy Williams demonstrates how using a smartphone app helped her secure a better deal, and other apps like Commute and Travel Money Tracker address additional travel problems. The overall message is that technology enhances travel.

The correct answer is D
