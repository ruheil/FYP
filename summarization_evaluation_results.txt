Kim Kardashian and Rita Ora have been making headlines for rocking latex this year but they're not the first - and the won't be the last - to show off the risque look. Once the sartorial statement of choice in sex clubs, latex, PVC and wet-look leather has been treated to a high fashion makeover but can real women pull off the skin-tight look? Or do you need the body - and the confidence - of an A-lister to wear it? FEMAIL called on the designer behind Kim and Rita's famous looks to custom design a latex dress from scratch for one of our writers - who says she's never felt more confident. Scroll down for video . Can ANYONE pull off latex like Kim Kardashian? MailOnline writer Hanna Flint had a dress custom-made by the star's favourite designer, Atsuko Kudo, and she felt 'amazing' in her showstopping outfit . Kim Kardashian wore her Kudo latex dress in September and Hanna had her own version custom made to prove that you don't have to be a megastar to rock the risque fabric . From Kate Moss to Dita Von Teese, Atsuko Kudo has designed latex outfits for a who's who of showbiz and Kim just can't get enough of the skin-tight looks. Plus, judging by the catwalks at fashion week, it will be filling our wardrobes in months to come, so Hanna Flint, our 26-year-old writer, was in safe hands. Hanna, who is a size 12, visited Atsuko's studio in Islington, north London, for a fitting - as while her designs can be bought off the rack (something Rita Ora does), Atsuko recommends that she fits all of her clients either in person or online. After being measured, Hanna tried on a variety of colours - from peach to black - and differing styles, to see which she felt most comfortable in. 'It's a really personal experience,' explains the brand's managing director, Simon Hoare. 'Latex is perfect for a special moment and it's all about feeling and looking great in it. You have to commit to putting in the time to get a fitting so that the final outfit looks like it's painted on.' Hanna and the team decided the black suited her skin tone and hair colour so she had one made from scratch and had to use lubricant to slip into the dress for the final shoot . Hanna said that maybe with a strategically placed blouse or jacket, she could reduce the focus of her top half for a night out on the town . Hanna and the team decided the black suited her skin tone and hair colour so she had one made from scratch. The process involves gluing the latex together to the customer's precise measurements and requirements. Explaining the experience, Hanna said: 'At the fitting, Atsuko and the team brought out a few options for me to try, but at first they didn’t take my measurements rather took a look at me and gauged which size would fit. 'Clearly they have a good eye for it as the dresses actually fitted very well on the body, though they had to make my bust size and cup bigger (just like Kim!). 'I definitely needed a hand putting on the dress, and the stylist put talc on the inside of the dress so it could slip on better. I say slip, but that wasn’t the case as there was a lot of pulling and squeezing to make sure the seams were lined up and there wasn’t any ridges in the latex. 'Once I stepped out and saw myself I had to admit, it was a pretty "wow" moment. I do have some lumps and bumps but the dress really streamlined it and I really get why Kim is such a fan. I actually really liked the black dress with the plunging neckline, because as a woman with a bust, it’s hard to wear that sort of cut without accidentally suffering a nipple slip! Thanks to the tight latex there was no danger of that. 'It’s amazing how 15 minutes in the dress can become rather hot work and after trying on three, I did feel thoroughly flushed. Hats off to Ella Eyre who rocked an Atsuko Kudo latex dress for her energetic concert recently!'. Atsuko Kudo takes Hanna's measurements in her Islington boutique . Is that Kim Kardashian? Writer Hanna is proof that you don't have to be a reality star or celebrity to look sensational - and super stylish - in skintight latex . And a few days later, Hanna received her bespoke design. 'Finally putting on the custom-made dress was amazing,' said Hanna, of the final shoot. 'It fitted perfectly to my shape and bust size but I would probably need a hand to get it on in the first place - and maybe when I visit the ladies' room. 'The great thing about the latex is that once it's in position, it does streamline your figure. 'Kim probably has more confidence to wear such a cleavage-enhancing dress on the town than me, but maybe with a strategically placed blouse or jacket I could reduce the focus of my top half for a night out. 'I probably wouldn't wear it to go dancing in. It does get a little hot under the latex and I doubt Kim would be seen with a sweat on.' While Hanna opted for a copy Kim look, Atsuko emphasises that you don't necessarily have to wear head-to-toe latex. She said: 'I make accessories, millinery, shorts and skirts so  you can mix and match.' Atsuko first discovered the fabric when she was at fashion college in Japan 20 years ago. She was tasked with finding a quirky material on the high street and ventured into  a sex shop and from that day made it her mission  to create clothes using latex. Hanna, 26, tries out a skintight latex cocktail dress with cap sleeves and plunging V-neck in Atsuko's shop . Hanna is measured for her bespoke, strappy, cleavage-enhancing latex dress, which is just like Kim's . After moving to London, she started brand her eponymous brand in 2000 and was credited with being the first designer to offer a feminine take on latex. Her work quickly got picked up by Dita Von Teese and iconic photographer Steven Meisel used four pages of Eva Mendes wearing the fabric in Italian Vogue in 2007. 'That was such a moment,' recalled Simon. 'It looked so great and sexy on her; that was the real turning point.' Other stars were quickly recognising the brand and Atsuko was dressing Lady Gaga non-stop from 2008. Atsuko dressed her when she was supporting The Pussy Cat Dolls on tour, as well as for most of her music videos, including Telephone with Beyonce, who she also dressed. Kim Kardashian and Rita Ora showed up to a party earlier this year in near-identical latex dresses by Atsuko Kudo...and they're just two of the stars jumping on the bandwagon . Hanna tried on Rita and Kim's favourite blush-coloured latex shade too at the shop before finally settling on the black option, which better suited her skin tone and hair colour . Another major moment came when for the brand when Lady Gaga asked Atsuko to dress her for her meeting with the Queen, who the designer cites as her 'dream client'. 'I would love to dress the queen in a latex suit, a colourful one - with a hat.' On a standard week day, Kate Moss and Rita Ora may 'rock up' at the brand's shop in Islington, and Kim may well be unveiling more looks in the coming months. Simon said: 'She tends to save her latex looks for special moments. It divides opinion but, overall, because Kim is so curvy, it has made a lot of curvier women think "if she is wearing it, then I am going to give it a go". 'She is the first iconic figure for some time in fashion who has had real curves. And Kanye certainly likes her in it.' Kim has long championed the material and made headlines when she wore a  look by same the designer back in November for a fragrance launch in Australia, left, and to watch husband Kanye perform, right . Mrs Kanye West isn't the only celebrity to wear Atsko Kudo designs: the elaborate red dress Lady Gaga wore to meet Queen Elizabeth in 2009 was created by the designer . Ella Eyre wore one of the designs on stage at her recent gig - and proved you can jump around in it . Sarah, Duchess of York, left, Kate Moss, centre, and singer Charli XCX, right, have all trailed the trend (although some looks are more daring than others)

Saucy: The Athena poster that led to the apology . It's the cheeky poster that adorned the bedroom walls of countless teenage boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Whether Athena's tennis girl is a suitable adornment for the genteel surrounds of the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum is another matter entirely. Following a volley of criticism and cries of sexism on social media, the All England Lawn Tennis Club was forced to apologise for using the iconic poster to promote a forthcoming exhibition. Earlier yesterday they had tweeted a photograph of the dress worn by the blonde model and her racket, alongside the famous image, to promote its Powerful Posters exhibition, due to open tomorrow. That such a saucy shot should appear to have won the approval of the historic and respectable club immediately raised eyebrows on Twitter. Tennis fan Kishore Sharma was outraged, writing: 'Can't believe Wimbledon used this pic for upcoming 'Powerful Poster Exhibition'.' Roger Federer fans who call themselves 'Fed's Angels' on Twitter, posted: 'Come on Wimble! I thought you were the classy slam!' The offending image was swiftly deleted from the official Wimbledon Twitter account and a new post went up which said: 'We apologise for offence caused by the Athena Tennis Girl poster. It is a controversial piece of poster history but we do not endorse it.' The All England Lawn Tennis Club used the iconic poster to promote a forthcoming exhibition . However, a Twitter user responded with the comment: 'The poster doesn't show the history of tennis, the girl isn't a tennis player, you are just publicising sexualisation of females.' And campaign group the Everyday Sexism Project asked: 'Wimbledon having deleted your tweet, can you confirm if the poster you tweeted will be included in your exhibition?' Last night an All England Club spokesman said the poster would remain in the exhibition despite the apology. He added: 'We're aware that the poster has generated debate on social media and we decided to respond to some of the comments raised since we want to be clear that it is not a reflection of how we view women in tennis. 'The image in question is from a 1970s poster that was extremely popular, selling over 2million copies worldwide and it is part of an historic exhibition about tennis posters dating back to 1893. 'Not to include it in the exhibition would perhaps be an oversight since it is the most famous tennis poster of all time and should be regarded in this context only.' Use of the saucy shot on the official Twitter page immediately raised eyebrows on Twitter . Last night tennis fans were questioning whether the poster, one of the world's best-selling, really is that controversial after all. One Twitter user said: 'Come on Wimble! I thought you were the classy slam!' Sadie Hochfield tweeted: 'Ridiculous Wimbledon are getting stick for sharing iconic poster. Political correctness gone mad/don't pretend you've never seen it before!' Sara Smith-Jones posted: 'Wimbledon [has] nothing to apologise for – I think it's a great poster, is of its time in history.' Mark Staniforth said: 'Wimbledon has just tweeted an apology for any 'offence' caused by a link to the 40-year-old Athena Girl poster. The world's gone mad.' Others merely saw the funny side. 'I think Wimbledon were right to delete the Athena poster tweet,' one Twitter user wrote. 'No one should have to see that appalling 1970s court surface again.' The year-long exhibition will range from the earliest poster in the museum's collection, an 1893 advertisement for The Championships, through to the original artwork for this year's Grand Slam at the world famous venue in London SW19.

An aide to a former United States senator revealed she was on the phone with Missouri Auditor Tom Schweich discussing rumors about his religion moments before he killed himself. Schweich, 54, fatally shot himself on February 26 in an apparent suicide at his home in Clayton. Former US Sen. John Danforth's assistant Martha Fitz said Schweich threatened to kill himself during their conversation about the angst he was feeling over false rumors he was Jewish. Scroll down for video . Missouri Auditor Tom Schweich, 54, fatally shot himself in an apparent suicide at his home in Clayton last week . Schweich at his swearing-in ceremony with wife, Kathy (left), son Thomas (above), and daughter Emile (right) Emergency services were called to Schweich's home on the morning of February 26 after he shot himself . After making the threat, he handed the phone to his wife Kathy, Fitz said in a written statement. She wrote: 'Seconds later, I heard Kathy say, 'He shot himself!'" Fitz added: 'He spoke solely about his outrage concerning the rumors that were being spread about his religion and how he should respond to those rumors. 'I told him I thought it was best to let others stand up for him.' Schweich was Christian and attended church, but had some Jewish ancestry. The auditor's chief of staff, Trish Vincent, also talked with Schweich before his death. She said he told her he hadn't slept because he had been physically ill for most of the night before his suicide. In a written statement, she said Schweich 'was distraught, as he had been the last few days, regarding untruths about his religion'. On Tuesday during Schweich's funeral, Danforth eulogized his friend. Danforth, a political mentor and longtime ally to Schweich, is an ordained Episcopal minister. He suggested political bullying and an anti-Semitic whisper campaign led his friend to kill himself. Danforth expressed 'overwhelming anger that politics has gone so hideously wrong' as he spoke at the Church of St. Michael and St. George, the Episcopal church Schweich had attended in Clayton. He said: 'Words do hurt. Words can kill. 'That has been proven right here in this state.' He then urged the audience to disown 'winning at any cost' campaigns run by 'bullies' and to pledge 'that we will not put up with any whisper of anti-Semitism', the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Danforth delivered the eulogy at Schweich's funeral and said political bullying was to blame for his suicide . Family members of Schweich embrace outside the Church of St. Michael and St. George at his funeral . Former US Sen. John Danforth's (left) assistant Martha Fitz (right) was talking to Schweich before his suicide . Schweich, a Republican, launched an anti-corruption campaign for governor last month and was thought to have a good chance of winning. Last month, Schweich told an Associated Press reporter the believed the new chairman of the Missouri Republican Party - John Hancock - told people he was Jewish last year. Schweich said he considered the comments anti-Semitic and was extremely upset by them. Hancock has denied making anti-Semitic remarks. He has acknowledged he may have told some people Schweich was Jewish because he mistakenly believed that was true. Danforth responded to Hancock's denial without mentioning him by name. He said: 'Tom called this anti-Semitism, and of course it was. 'The only reason for going around saying that someone is Jewish is to make political profit from religious bigotry.' Schweich was first elected in 2010 and easily won election to a second term in November. He previously served as Danforth's chief of staff for a 1999 federal investigation into the deadly government siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, and followed Danforth to the United Nations, where he was chief of staff for the US. delegation. President George W. Bush appointed Schweich to the State Department in 2005 as an international law enforcement official and picked Schweich two years later to coordinate the anti-drug and justice reform efforts in Afghanistan. In addition to his wife, Schweich also leaves behind two children, Thomas and Emile. • For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here . • For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .

United Nations (CNN)Tour groups and diplomats breeze past a nondescript display of 35 blown-up photos printed on poster board. Suddenly, one tourist catches a glimpse of the subject of one of the photos: a man whose eyes have been gouged out. Manjula Sharma, visiting the United Nations from India, gasps when she realizes what she is looking at. "How could anybody do this?" she said, while looking at the photos with a pained expression. "It's not war. It's not drought. It's not natural calamity. It's torture." The exhibit is tucked away behind the lobby of the U.N. Secretariat Building. It's a no-frills exhibition of photos taken by a man who is being called "Caesar," a Syrian government defector whose job it was to take photos of dead detainees for the military police. Caesar claimed to take up to 50 photos a day, and brought nearly 27,000 images like these out of the country. Captions on the photos show that many of them were taken inside military hospitals, and accuse Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime in the torture and killings. The photos show emaciated bodies. Some have eyes gouged out, some have genitals removed. And many are covered with wounds, the flesh peeling from their bodies. It's a sight that gave pause to Anders Frantzen, who works at the United Nations and was running late to a meeting. "I told myself I really wanted to come back here and take a proper look. It looks like something you haven't seen since the Second World War. It's very bad," Frantzen said. "It's difficult to put a face, an image to the numbers we hear about. So you see these pictures (and) it sort of puts things in a new perspective." While the photos have been shown before Congress and in media reports, many people, like Sharma, had no idea they existed. That's partly why Mouaz Moustafa, senior political adviser to the Coalition for a Democratic Syria, said he placed the photos in this location. He wanted to bring awareness to the public and put pressure on U.N. Security Council member states to vote for the International Criminal Court to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. "If you ask anyone about ISIS from Mississippi to Alabama, everyone is so well aware of this obviously evil entity," Moustafa said. "If you compare it to the horrendous crimes of the Assad regime, it doesn't get, I feel, it doesn't get the same coverage." The Syrian Mission to the United Nations did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the exhibit. The exhibit will be at the United Nations until March 24.

England fell agonisingly short of claiming an astonishing Six Nations title as Stuart Lancaster's side ran in seven tries to beat France on one of the most astonishing days in the history of the Championship. Going into the game knowing they needed to win by 26 clear points, Stuart Lancaster's team produced an incredible show of attacking rugby which saw them finish one of the most remarkable matches in Twickenham history broken, but not bowed. England's players were left distraught as the realisation they had finished so near but so far away from winning the title. For the fourth year running under Lancaster, his side must settle for second place in the championship but this was a stunning performance that will see them take enormous confidence into the World Cup.

They have reason to be proud. Twelve tries were scored in total - seven against five - but ultimately England finished six points adrift of the total they needed as Ireland claimed the title for the second season running. England could barely have done any more but were punished for a second-half lapse of discipline which saw James Haskell sin binned for tripping and France scored two tries. 'We're absolutely devastated,' said man-of-the-match Ben Youngs, who scored two tries. 'For all our endeavour, we fell short. We're gutted.' Ireland's crushing victory over Scotland at Murrayfield earlier in the afternoon left England with a huge mountain to climb. England began the game knowing they must win by the unlikely margin of 26 points to win the first championship of Lancaster's tenure. It was always going to be a huge ask against a French side that, for all its faults, had conceded just two tries in four matches leading into this Twickenham clash. Suddenly, the perceived advantage of playing the final game of the tournament had become a burden of pressure around England's throat. Lancaster had recalled experienced Leicester lock Geoff Parling in place of Dave Attwood and kept faith with the backline which squandered try after try against Scotland last Saturday. Parling's Leicester team-mate Dan Cole led his side out on his 50th cap and England knew they would need a titanic set-piece performance, first and foremost, to stand a realistic chance of pulling off a stunning championship win. And from the very first scrum there were indications they may deliver as England wheeled their opposing eight enough for No8 Billy Vunipola to put extreme pressure on France scrum half Sebastien Tillous-Borde. The France No9 threw a pass to nowhere with Vunipola breathing down his neck and England centre Jonathan Joseph – England's find of the tournament – gathered and fed the ball down the right to full back Mike Brown. Brown worked the ball to George Ford who flipped a clever pass inside to Ben Youngs who pirouetted over the line for a try inside 90 seconds. Ford added the conversion from the right hand touchline to make it 7-0 and England were away. Only a missed penalty attempt dampened the crowd's enthusiasm. Then, disaster struck as Courtney Lawes fumbled a pass from Youngs down the right and Tillous-Borde snaffled the ball with only Cole covering across and the line at his mercy. There was no contest. The France scrum half sped in from fully 60 metres to silence the Twickenham crowd. Plisson missed the conversion but moments later France went even further ahead when winger Noa Nakaitaci broke away down the left to score his side's second try inside a couple of minutes. But the left winger can consider himself incredibly fortunate after he brainlessly attempted to run around under the posts only to touch the ball down milliseconds before his left foot stepped over the dead ball line. The Television Match Official agonised over the decision and eventually, after countless replays, the try was awarded. England's Jack Nowell goes over for his second try of the match but England could not find enough points to jump above Ireland . France's Noa Nakaitaci scores a controversial try after getting away from Youngs during the first half . Nakaitaci was deemed to be in control of the ball as he touched it down before falling over the dead ball line . England's Jonathan Joseph (centre) is tackled by France duo Maxime Mermoz (left) and Vincent Debaty . England's players were left to rue some costly mistakes as they missed out on yet another Six Nations title under Lancaster . Plisson's conversion made it 15-7 after 17 minutes and suddenly England's task was even greater than at kick off. Lawes caused a mini fracas when his huge hit on Plisson angered France, although referee Nigel Owens deemed the tackle was fair. Ford then reduced the deficit to five points with a long-range penalty and Plisson missed back-to-back penalties to deny France the chance to pull further ahead. Now it was England's turn to get lucky. Youngs made a searing 40 metre break down the right and fed inside to Ford who was tackled short of the line. James Haskell dipped for the ball but appeared to knock on in the process before gathering and popping to Anthony Watson to cross. But this time the TMO ruled in England's favour and the try was awarded with the ball deemed to have come off Haskell's knee. Ford converted to make it 17-15 after 31 minutes. Game on again. In an astonishing game, Joseph then broke from his own line to make 70 metres before chipping ahead for Luther Burrell. The centre lost out to Bernard Le Roux but earned a penalty which England took quickly and Youngs wriggled over for his side's third try. Ford converted to make it 24-15 and England dared to dream again. A Ford penalty on the stroke of half time left England 27-15 in front after a memorable half but Maime Memoz crossed two minutes into the second half to leave the home side 21 points away from claiming the title. Seven of those came four minutes later when Youngs, enjoying his best game in an England shirt, made a searing break down the right and fed inside for Ford to canter over for his side's fourth try. Ford converted his own try to make it 34-22. Lawes is grabbed by his shirt during the first half as France's players let their frustrations boil over . George Ford slides on to his right side as he scores England's fourth try of the afternoon and first of the second half .

Danny Cipriani drives forward late on during England's desperate search for points at Twickenham . Dylan Hartley conceded a needless penalty which replacement Rory Kockott kicked. It was Hartley's last act as he was replaced by Tom Youngs on 52 minutes. England struck again when Jack Nowell crossed after more good work from Youngs and Ford's conversion made it 41-25 after 53 minutes. But England's delight was tempered when Haskell was sent to the sin bin for a blatant trip on Plisson. With Haskell off the pitch, France broke again and Nakaitaci made a searing run down the left. Brown looked to have stopped him but the winger flicked a clever pass to the supporting Vincent Debaty and the prop scored. Kockott missed the conversion leaving the deficit at 11 points. Danny Cipriani was introduced to the fray at full back on 61 minutes with Watson going off and Brown moving to the wing. Within seconds England scored again when Vunipola drove over and Ford converted, leaving England 18 points in front. It was utterly astonishing stuff. France scored their fifth try when replacement Benjamin Kayser drove over from a line out but Kockott missed again to leave the score 48-35. Haskell was replaced by Tom Wood as England began to sense their title hopes were slipping away. But in keeping with this incredible game, Nowell crossed for his second try after clever work by Ford, who converted, to leave England needing six more points with four minutes left.

This is the moment a five foot long unexploded Second World War bomb discovered under a building site in south London was blown up. A controlled explosion was carried out in a quarry at Cliffe in Kent this morning after the German device was discovered under a former pensioners home in Bermondsey in the Southwark borough on Monday. Soldiers of 11 EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment) Royal Logistics Corps used two kilogrammes of high explosives  to blow up the Luftwaffe Sprengbombe-Cylindrisch bomb. Scroll down for video . Explosion: The unexploded German bomb found in Bermondsey, south London was blown up at a quarry in Kent at 9am this morning . Detonation: Staff Sergeant Ed Clinton (left) and Sergeant Rich McKinnon (right), of 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regt Royal Army Corps placed the charges on the bomb and then walked back to a safe area 500 metres to fire the charge . The 1,000lb explosive was transported to the site in Kent, owned by Brett Aggregates, inside a skip packed with sand and loaded onto a lorry, which was flanked by police yesterday. The area in Bermondsey, Southwark, which was severely bombed during the Blitz in the Second World War, was put into lockdown from Monday night. It is believed the bomb was dropped over London by the Luftwaffe on 11 May 1941 but unusually did not detonate. More than 1,200 people were evacuated from their homes following the discovery by builders working on the construction site of the former Southwark Irish Pensioners centre. A police cordon sealed off 200 metres of land surrounding the bomb site for 32 hours as the Army built a bunker around the bomb to safely defuse it. The  teams, who had previously worked on Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland, used Hesco blast walls, like those used to build Camp Bastion and other military bases in Afghanistan during the conflict there. A soldier in charge of removing it has revealed that if the bomb had exploded it could have led to 'major loss of life' and significant damage to buildings. Senior Ammunition Technician John Lester said it was a 'a live munition in a dangerous condition' which had to be taken far from the city before it could be safely destroyed. SAT Lester, of 11 EOD, Royal Logistic Corps, said: 'This bomb was a live munition in a dangerous condition. It had been disturbed by some pretty heavy building machinery, which is never a good thing. Bombs don't like being bashed around. 'But once we'd uncovered it, we knew what we were dealing with and it was just a question of solving the puzzle quickly so we could get it away and the good residents of Bermondsey back in their homes. 'We knew we had to get it away to dispose of it safely because trying to deal onsite with a bomb that size, even under a controlled explosion, would cause significant damage to buildings, (and) property, and the risk of major loss of life in such a highly populated part of the city was very high.'

Around 80 people were re-homed in hotels or empty council accommodation, while others had to sleep at houses of friends and family. Hot meals and tea and coffee were provided for nearly 70 people at the Seven Islands Leisure Centre and Canada Water Library during the day. Scotland Yard confirmed at around 6pm  that the area was deemed safe and residents could return to their homes. Residents were commended for their 'Blitz spirit' by local councillor Lucas Green, who referred to the residents as the 'evacuees of 2015', and said they had a mass phone charger swap', which was 'the modern day cup of sugar'. Cllr Peter John, Leader of Southwark Council has thanked the emergency services, St Johns Ambulance and the Red Cross for their support at the rest centres. He added: 'Thankfully we don't have to deal with unexploded bombs very often, but we do have plans in place to deal with such emergencies, and they work. Once again I want to thank residents for their patience and co-operation while the army and police carried out their work.' Transported: The fuse on the unexploded bomb was made safe by experts before it was loaded onto a lorry inside a skip filled with sand .

Dartford Police warned residents in Kent that there would be a loud explosion this morning but they needn't panic. The Ministry of Defence said it had had reports that this morning's explosion could be heard 10 miles (16km) away. Writing on Twitter, they said: 'EXPLOSION: Plz don't panic if you hear a loud bang... Army due to safely detonate a WWII UXB discovered in London yesterday.' Residents reported hearing a loud bang after the explosion at around 9am claiming it 'rattled' houses. Andy B posted on social media: 'Massive bang heard in Meopham, house shaken!!'. On The Thames said: 'Judging by the massive bang and thud just then in Kent, I'd say the #Bermondseybomb is no more!'. Residents were evacuated on Monady night after the 1,000lb German ordnance was discovered by builders under the old site of the Southwark Irish Pensioners. Pictured: Bomb disposal experts excavate the device . A bunker was built around the bomb by Royal Engineers of 33EOD to protect the surrounding buildings in case of accidental detonation.

It is always satisfying to get a beautiful picture of a landscape, mountain or lake that you have visited. Gregor Skoberne, however, takes dedication to the next level by photographing Slovenia's Lake Bohinj every day during summer, and experimenting with paragliding to capture its reflective surface from different angles. The  lake is situated in the Triglav National Park and is the largest permanent lake in Slovenia, perfectly mirroring the surrounding mountains in its waters. Reflective beauty: The stunning Lake Bohinj in Slovenia is less well-known than the popular Lake Bled, and is in pristine condition due to the lack of tourists . Lake Bohinj's orientation results in fascinating light which is perfect for capturing its surrounding mountains and reflections . The 14th century church on the lake is featured on the coat of arms of the  Bohinj municipality and makes for a beautiful keepsake picture . Gregor Skoberne captures Lake Bohinj every day during summer, working at the local tourist information office during that period to be closer . Lake Bohinj is not as famous as popular tourist destination, Lake Bled, but the lack of visitors allows the area to maintain its pristine condition. Photographer Gregor Skoberne, 23, became so spellbound by Lake Bohinj that during summers he now works for the local tourist association in order to be closer to photograph it, as he lives 30 minutes away. 'I was amazed that every day there was something different at the lake, be it light, clouds, fog, reflections or different colors of the leaves,' he said. 'Secondly, I love symmetry and taking reflection shots and Lake Bohinj surrounded with mountains is perfect for that.' Taking to the skies! Gregor enjoys capturing the lake from all angles, including capturing reflections of the clouds while paragliding . To photograph the lake from varied perspectives, Gregor has even gone so far as climbing to the top of nearby waterfall Savica . The lake is situated in the Triglav National Park and is the largest permanent lake in Slovenia . The Slovenian's interest in photography started when he received his first digital SLR camera, his father's Nikon D70s . Gregor now uses a Nikon D5100 with the Nikkor 18-105mm and 12-24mm lenses to capture the stunning Slovenian lake . The Agronomy student, 23, is currently doing a master thesis on visualization of root growth using Time Lapse technique, but hopes to do something professionally that's connected with photography. 'When you see something beautiful in nature, it’s hard to describe another person what you saw and how amazing it was, so I’m trying to capture that on my camera so others can enjoy that too,' he said. One of his most challenging shots occurred following a climb down a stone wall to get to the Savica waterfall. However, the resulting photograph was one that only a true artist would have been able to create. But for Greggor, the best photograph that he has taken of the body of water was while flying above, thanks to the spectacular reflection of the clouds on the lake. His photography can be followed on Facebook and Instagram.

Query 1 Response:
The article explores the growing trend of latex in high fashion, driven by celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Rita Ora, who have popularized the material beyond its association with sex clubs. Designer Atsuko Kudo, known for her work with icons such as Dita Von Teese, Lady Gaga, and Kate Moss, created a custom latex dress for MailOnline writer Hanna Flint to test whether everyday women can pull off the skin-tight look. Hanna, a size 12, visited Kudo's studio in London, tried multiple styles and colors, and had a black dress made to fit her measurements. The process involved precise measurements, lubricant for fitting, and a stylist to assist. She noted that the dress streamlined her figure and boosted her confidence, though she acknowledged the heat and effort required. Kudo emphasizes that latex can be styled with accessories and doesn't have to be worn head-to-toe, making it accessible for curvier women. The trend is expected to continue, with more designs and styles becoming available. The article raises questions about whether this trend democratizes fashion or remains exclusive to A-listers, challenging traditional beauty standards or catering to a narrow ideal. While it can be a confidence-boosting choice, latex may also be associated with objectification or exploitation, particularly in the context of the sex industry. The fashion industry should balance promoting inclusivity and body positivity with addressing potential drawbacks and broader cultural implications.

Query 5 Response:
The United Nations hosts an inconspicuous exhibit of 35 photographs taken by a Syrian government defector known as "Caesar," depicting atrocities committed in Syrian detention facilities under the Assad regime. These graphic images, showing emaciated bodies with signs of severe torture, aim to raise awareness about the conflict and pressure the UN Security Council to address war crimes and crimes against humanity. The exhibit, located in a quiet area of the UN Secretariat Building, has drawn limited public notice despite prior media exposure and congressional awareness. Advocates like Mouaz Moustafa seek to highlight the underreported nature of Assad's crimes compared to ISIS. The Syrian Mission to the UN has not responded to requests for comment, and the exhibit's location may reflect an intentional strategy to avoid controversy or spark debate, impacting its legitimacy and reach.

**Final Answer:**

England's rugby team, under coach Stuart Lancaster, delivered an impressive performance in their final match of the 2016 Six Nations Championship against France. Despite their best efforts, they fell short of winning the title by six points, finishing second for the fourth consecutive year. The match was a high-scoring and dramatic affair, with England scoring seven tries to France's five. England's early lead was quickly countered by France's strong second-half performance, which included a controversial try by Noa Nakaitaci. Despite a late comeback, England couldn't overcome their second-half lapses in discipline and the pressure of needing a 26-point victory. The match highlighted England's attacking prowess but also revealed areas that need improvement, particularly in maintaining discipline and capitalizing on key moments. England's performance has provided a solid foundation for their World Cup preparations, with key players like Ben Youngs showing exceptional form. To secure future titles, England should focus on maintaining their attacking creativity while addressing defensive lapses and improving their ability to handle high-pressure situations. Their progress and adaptability will be crucial as they aim for success in the 2015 Rugby World Cup.

A 1,000-pound unexploded World War II-era German bomb, identified as a Luftwaffe Sprengbombe-Cylindrisch, was discovered under a construction site in Bermondsey, South London. Discovered by builders on Monday, it prompted the evacuation of over 1,200 residents and a 200-meter police cordon. The bomb, believed to have been dropped on May 11, 1941, was transported to a quarry in Kent, where it was safely detonated using 2 kilograms of explosives. The explosion, heard up to 10 miles away, was controlled thanks to the use of Hesco blast walls built by the Royal Engineers. If detonated, it could have caused significant damage and loss of life. Emergency services, including the army and police, coordinated with local authorities to manage the situation, and residents were commended for their cooperation.

The U.S. Justice Department has charged two former federal agents, Carl Force and Shaun Bridges, with stealing over $890,000 in Bitcoin during their investigation of the Silk Road, an underground drug marketplace that generated around $200 million in sales before its 2013 shutdown. Force, a former DEA agent, was the lead undercover agent in communication with Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht, using official aliases but also creating unauthorized personas to extort $250,000 from Ulbricht and steal $90,000 worth of Bitcoin. Bridges, a Secret Service agent, diverted over $800,000 worth of Bitcoin to his personal account. Both agents have been arrested, with Force appearing in court in Baltimore and Bridges surrendering in San Francisco.

Gregor Skoberne, a 23-year-old Slovenian photographer, dedicates himself to capturing Lake Bohinj daily during summer, using paragliding and climbing to achieve unique perspectives. Located in Triglav National Park, Lake Bohinj is Slovenia's largest permanent lake and renowned for its pristine condition and reflective beauty, often mirroring surrounding mountains. Less famous than Lake Bled, it attracts fewer tourists, preserving its natural state. Skoberne works at the local tourist information office to stay close to the lake, which he finds endlessly inspiring due to its changing light, clouds, and reflections. His photography, using a Nikon D5100 with specialized lenses, includes challenging shots from the Savica waterfall. Despite his academic focus on agronomy and a master's thesis on root growth visualization, he aspires to pursue photography professionally. His best work, a paragliding shot capturing cloud reflections, exemplifies his artistic dedication. His photos are shared on Facebook and Instagram.
