1. The illegal ivory trade has been a major problem in Africa for decades. Poachers  and hunters have killed off hundreds of thousands of elephants to obtain this precious material. Now, affected areas are taking action. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced on Wednesday that key states where poaching takes place have promised to stop the ivory trade and protect Africa's elephants. In the 1980s, as many as 1 million elephants across Africa were killed for their ivory tusks. This continued until 1989, when the Convention on International Trade in Species (CITES) voted to ban all trade in ivory. With trade , demand for ivory fell. Elephant populations slowly began to increase. However, this progress was short-lived. According to the IUCN, 2011 saw the highest levels of poaching and illegal ivory trading in at least 16 years. Around 25,000 elephants were killed in Africa that year. Preliminary data from the IUCN shows even higher levels of illegal trade may have been reached in 2013. "With about 22,000 elephants illegally killed in 2012, we continue to face a critical situation," said John E. Scanlon, CITES Secretary-General. "Current elephant poaching in Africa remains far too high, and could soon lead to local extinctions if the present killing rate continues." At the African Elephant Summit, key African states where elephants make their home agreed to develop a "zero-tolerance attitude" towards poaching. The deal calls for maximum sentences for poachers and hunters, and increased cooperation between affected states. Officials are determined to classifying wildlife trading as a serious crime -- and to making sure that the people who commit it are punished. All participants at the conference agreed to sign the deal. With these states coming together, there may yet be hope for elephants. (293 words) What's the best title for this passage?
A) New Hope for Elephants.
B) Elephants are dying.
C) Elephants are valuable.
D) How to protect elephants

2. When you discuss about eating out with your friend, first of all, you must make it clear who will pay for the meal.If somebody suggests having lunch with his friend, he might simply say something like this "I'm afraid it'll have to be some place nearby ,as I have little money." The other person may say. "OK. I'll meet you at  Mcdonald's." This means he has agreed that the two will go Dutch, that is, each person pays for himself. He may say "Oh, no. I want to take you for lunch at Johnson's " This means the person is to pay the  bill for both of them. Although the other person is pleased with the invitation, there is one reason why he shouldn't accept it by simply saying "Thank you." American customs are much the same as those in other parts of the world. American women used to expect men to pay for all the meals. But today, some of them like to. However, if a woman is asked to attend a dinner or a dance outside, the invitaton itself means "Come as my guest". So, as you see, it is a polite thing to make the situation clear at the very beginning. If your friend doesn't want to pay for the meal, he may say  _  .
A) I'm afraid it will have to be some place nearby
B) Come as my guest
C) Oh, no. I want to take you for lunch at Johnson's
D) I don't want to go anywhere

3. It's generally thought to be impolite not to give waiters some money as a tip after getting good services in western countries. However, hard economic times mean tourists are giving fewer tips, according to a survey .    As many as one third of holidaymakers are giving smaller tips or have stopped tipping entirely, the survey by TripAdvisor found. Also, only 46% of British always know what is expected in the way of tips in other countries. The survey of 5,595 travellers, including 1,197 from the UK, showed that 41% of European travellers were tipping less or not at all this year. A total of 63% of European travellers knew how to tip in other countries, with Italians coming first.    The survey also showed that 29% of British tended to give the same amount in tips whatever country they were in. As many as 8% of British said they had had a holiday ruined by a bad tipping experience, while 16% said they they had been once in a situaiton where the waiter complained about the amount of the tip. Also, 12% of British said tipping on holiday made them nervous, while 22% said  _ . TripAdvisor spokeswoman Emma Shaw said: "It's been a challenging year for the British economy and Brits are spending very carefully. While the majority are still rewarding good service on holidays with tips, many Brits are giving smaller tips as cost-saving continues to be important." Why do the tourists give fewer tips?
A) The tipping culture has greatly changed.
B) They are not satisfied with the service.
C) They are suffering from tough economy.
D) They don't know how to tip in other countries.

5. Recently, I learned firsthand why it's a bad idea to judge people prematurely  . I'm a nursing supervisor, and my job is to evaluate workers' performances at the hospital. Kenny was a new employee. After weeks' probation  , I had to admit that he was clean, punctual and efficient. But he had this self-assured and energetic presence. He was a large man, both physically and socially -- he was independent and strong. I worried that our hospital, which demanded teamwork, was not right for such a personality. We had a patient named Mary. At 94 years old, Mary was weak. She had outlived her husband and sisters. Mary had an obsessive   belief that someone had taken her purse. She searched for it all the time. Unless tied to her wheelchair, she would go through the door onto the street mindlessly searching and never giving up. She was often sitting in her wheelchair in the hallway, where she stopped everyone who came near. "Can you lend me a comb?" she would ask. "I've lost mine. It was in my red purse. Where is my purse?" Every day it was the same. We all knew Mary didn't have a purse, but we would answer: "Sure, if I see your purse I'll bring it back." One afternoon, I saw Kenny walking down the hall with a grocery bag. He walked toward Mary in her wheelchair. He pulled out a red purse. Mary's old hands flew up to her face in a gesture of wonder and joy, and then flew out hungrily like a starved child taking bread. Mary grabbed the red purse. She held it for a moment, and then pressed it to her breast, rocking it like a baby. Kenny leaned over, unzipped the purse open and showed Mary a comb inside. Tears of joy poured down Mary's face. Instead of paying lip service like the rest of us, Kenny had made Mary's problem his problem. I had been wrong about Kenny. The author was worried that Kenny would not be fit for his job because   _  .
A) he had no working experience in medicine
B) he had a strong, confident and independent character
C) his performance during the probation didn't meet their standards
D) he was too stubborn and wouldn't listen to others' opinions

6. What is your favorite colour? Do you like yellow, orange, red? If you do, you must be an optimist  , a leader or an active person who enjoys life, people and excitement. Do you prefer grey and blue? Then you are probably quiet, shy and you would rather follow than lead. If you love green, you are strong-minded and determined . You wish to succeed and want other people to see you are successful. At least this is what psychologists tell us, and they should know, because they have been seriously studying the meaning of colour preference  , and the effect that colours have on human beings .They tell us that we don't choose our favorite colour as we grow up. If you happen to love brown, you did so as soon as you opened your eyes, or at least as soon as you could see clearly. A yellow room makes us feel more cheerful and comfortable than a dark green one, and a red dress brings warmth and cheer to the saddest winter day. On the other hand, black is depressing . Light and bright colours make people not only happier but also more active. It is a fact that factory workers work better, harder, and have fewer accidents when their machines are painted orange rather than black or dark grey . Remember, then, that if you feel low, you can always brighten your day or your life with a new shirt or a few colourful things. Remember also that you will know your friends and your enemies better when you find out what colours they like and dislike. And don't forget that anyone can guess a lot about your character when you choose a piece of handkerchief or a lampshade . I'm feeling black. means "  _   ".
A) I am feeling well.
B) I am very happy.
C) I am excited.
D) I am depressed

10. The host poured the tea into the cup and placed it on the small table in front of his guests, who were a father and daughter, and the cover on the cup. Apparently thinking of something, he hurried into the inner room, leaving the thermos  on the table. His two guests heard a cupboard opening. They remained sitting in the sitting room, the ten-year-old daughter looking at the flowers outside the window, the father just about to take his cup, when the crash came, right there in the sitting room. Something was hopelessly broken. It was the thermos, which had fallen to the floor. The girl looked over her shoulder, shocked, staring. It was mysterious. Neither of them touched it, not even a bit. True, it hadn't stood steadily when their host placed in on the table, but it hadn't fallen then. The explosion caused the host to rush back. _ the steaming floor, the host said, "It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!" The father started to say something. Then he said softly, "Sorry, I touched it and it fell." "It doesn't matter," said the host. When they left the house, the daughter said, "Daddy, did you touch it?" "No, but it stood so close to me." "But you did not touch it. I saw your reflection in the window glass." The father laughed. "What would you give as the cause of its fall?" "The thermos fell by itself. The floor is not smooth. Daddy, why did you say that you..." "That won't do, girl. It sounds more acceptable when I say I knocked it down. There are things which people accept less the more you defend. The truer the story you tell, the less true it sounds." The daughter was lost in silence for a while. Then she said, "Can you explain it only in this way?" "Only in this way," her father said. Which statement is a possible theme of this story?
A) People should take the blame for what they didn't do.
B) People rarely tell the truth.
C) If you defend yourself, people will believe you.
D) You can't always make people believe the truth.

Query 3 Response:
The reasons tourists give fewer tips can be attributed to a combination of factors, but the most significant ones are:

C) They are suffering from tough economy.
A) The tipping culture has greatly changed.

Let's break down these factors:

1. **Economic Factors (C)**:
   - **Hard Economic Times**: The economic downturn has led many tourists to be more cautious with their spending, including tipping. They may be trying to save money or prioritize other expenses.
   - **Cost-Conscious Travel**: With the rise of budget travel and the need to stretch travel budgets, tourists are more likely to cut back on tipping to save money.

2. **Changing Tipping Culture (A)**:
   - **Shift in Expectations**: There has been a shift in tipping culture, with some tourists feeling that tipping is not as expected or necessary as it once was. This is particularly true in countries where tipping is not customary or where service is included in the price.
   - **Increased Awareness**: Tourists are becoming more aware of the economic conditions of the service industry and may feel that tipping is not as important as it once was.

While the other options (B and D) may play a role in some cases, they are not the primary reasons for the decrease in tipping:

- **Service Satisfaction (B)**: While some tourists may not be satisfied with the service and choose not to tip, this is not the main reason for the overall decrease in tipping.
- **Lack of Knowledge (D)**: While some tourists may not know how to tip in other countries, this is not the primary reason for the decrease in tipping. The survey shows that a significant number of tourists are aware of tipping customs but are choosing to tip less or not at all.

In summary, the primary reasons for tourists giving fewer tips are economic factors and the changing tipping culture.

1. Luke and Sparky start on Vine Street.
2. They cross Willow Street.
3. They turn onto First Street.
4. They walk downhill on First Street.
5. They reach Elm Street, where the pond is located.

So, the correct answer is C.

Query 5 Response:
The author was worried that Kenny would not be fit for his job because:

B) he had a strong, confident and independent character

The author was concerned that Kenny's self-assured and energetic presence, as well as his independent and strong personality, might not align well with the hospital's emphasis on teamwork. This concern led the author to initially judge Kenny negatively, despite his clean, punctual, and efficient work performance. However, Kenny's actions towards Mary, such as taking the initiative to address her problem and providing her with a comb, demonstrated that his strong character could be an asset rather than a hindrance in the hospital environment.

Query 6 Response:
D) I am depressed

The phrase "I'm feeling black" is often used to express a sense of depression or sadness. The color black is often associated with negative emotions and sadness in many cultures. So, when someone says "I'm feeling black," they are likely expressing that they are feeling down or depressed.

Query 7 Response:
The passage discusses the importance of water in nature and the impact of pollution on aquatic ecosystems. The phrase "much important plant and animal life" refers to the diverse flora and fauna that thrive in these environments. Based on the context provided, the correct answer is:

D) mouth of a river

The mouth of a river is where it meets the ocean, and it is often a rich habitat for both plant and animal life due to the variety of conditions and the influx of nutrients from the river. This is where the river's water and the ocean's water mix, creating a unique ecosystem.

Query 8 Response:
Jenny's father's phone number is 13857428849.

Query 9 Response:
The question seems to be about the duration of daylight during a specific month, which is typically referred to as the length of day or photoperiod. Let's break down the options and provide clear explanations:

A) **Ending sooner**: This would be true if the month in question is one where the days are getting shorter, such as in the Northern Hemisphere during the fall or winter months. This is because the Earth's axis is tilted away from the sun, causing the days to be shorter.

B) **Overwhelming hot**: This option is not related to the duration of daylight. The temperature of a day is determined by factors such as the sun's angle, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions, not the length of the day.

C) **Lasting the longest**: This would be true if the month in question is one where the days are getting longer, such as in the Northern Hemisphere during the spring or summer months. This is because the Earth's axis is tilted towards the sun, causing the days to be longer.

D) **Growing new plants**: This is not directly related to the duration of daylight. While plants do grow during the day, the length of daylight is not the primary factor determining plant growth. Other factors such as temperature, water, and nutrients play a significant role.

Given these explanations, the correct answer would be:

C) **Lasting the longest**

This is because the duration of daylight is typically longest during the spring and summer months in the Northern Hemisphere.

Query 10 Response:
The story presents several themes, but the most prominent ones are:

A) **People should take the blame for what they didn't do.** - This is evident in the father's statement, "There are things which people accept less the more you defend." He realizes that by admitting he didn't touch the thermos, people might not believe him, so he takes the blame to make the story more acceptable.

D) **You can't always make people believe the truth.** - The father's realization that people might not believe his truthful account of the incident highlights this theme. He decides to take the blame to make the story more believable.

So, the most fitting themes from the given options are A and D.

Query 1 Response:
The best title for this passage is:

A) New Hope for Elephants.

This title accurately reflects the overall tone and content of the passage, which focuses on the efforts of African states to combat poaching and protect elephants, and the potential for a positive outcome. The other options do not capture the main theme of the passage:

* B) Elephants are dying: This title is too negative and doesn't convey the sense of hope and action that is present in the passage.
* C) Elephants are valuable: While it's true that elephants are valuable, this title doesn't capture the main focus of the passage, which is on the efforts to protect them.
* D) How to protect elephants: This title is too broad and doesn't specifically reflect the content of the passage, which focuses on the actions taken by African states to combat poaching.

It's worth noting that the passage presents a nuanced view of the issue, highlighting both the severity of the problem and the efforts being made to address it. The title "New Hope for Elephants" captures this nuance and suggests that the passage will explore the potential for a positive outcome.

Query 2 Response:
A great example of critical thinking and analysis!

Let's break down the situation and evaluate the options:

The text states that if someone suggests having lunch with their friend, they might say "I'm afraid it'll have to be some place nearby, as I have little money." This implies that the person is suggesting going Dutch, where each person pays for themselves.

The correct answer should reflect the friend's response to indicate that they don't want to pay for the meal. Let's analyze the options:

A) "I'm afraid it will have to be some place nearby" - This is the original suggestion, not a response to indicate that the person doesn't want to pay.

B) "Come as my guest" - This is an invitation to attend a dinner or dance, not a response to indicate that the person doesn't want to pay.

C) "Oh, no. I want to take you for lunch at Johnson's" - This is an invitation to pay for the meal, not a response to indicate that the person doesn't want to pay.

D) "I don't want to go anywhere" - This is a possible response from the friend to indicate that they don't want to pay for the meal, as it implies that they are not interested in going out.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

D) "I don't want to go anywhere"

This response makes it clear that the friend is not interested in paying for the meal and is not willing to go out.

Query 3 Response:
Based on the information provided, the most likely reason tourists are giving fewer tips is:

C) They are suffering from tough economy.

The article states that "It's been a challenging year for the British economy and Brits are spending very carefully." This suggests that the economic downturn is a significant factor in the decrease in tipping. Additionally, the TripAdvisor spokeswoman, Emma Shaw, mentions that "cost-saving continues to be important" for many Brits, further supporting this conclusion.

While option A, "The tipping culture has greatly changed," might be a contributing factor, it's not the primary reason mentioned in the article. Option B, "They are not satisfied with the service," is not supported by the article, as it only mentions the economic situation as the reason for the decrease in tipping. Option D, "They don't know how to tip in other countries," is also not supported, as the article states that 63% of European travelers knew how to tip in other countries, and only 46% of British were unsure.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) They are suffering from tough economy.

Query 4 Response:
Let's break down the information provided to determine the correct path Luke and Sparky take to the pond.

1. Luke walks up Vine Street to the stop sign. (This establishes that they are initially on Vine Street.)
2. Luke looks both ways and then walks across Willow street with Sparky. (This indicates a change in direction, from Vine Street to Willow Street.)
3. Luke and Sparky walk up the hill. (This suggests that they are moving in a generally upward direction, but the exact street is not specified.)
4. At the top of the hill, Luke and Sparky turn left. (This implies a change in direction, from going up the hill to going downhill.)
5. They walk downhill on First Street. (This establishes that they are on First Street, heading downhill.)
6. At the bottom of the hill, they see a small pond. The pond is on Elm Street. (This indicates that the pond is located on Elm Street, which is not the same as First Street.)

Now, let's analyze the options:

A) They stay on Vine Street the whole way. (This is incorrect, as they cross Willow Street and continue on First Street.)
B) Across First Street and taking a left turn to Elm Street. (This is incorrect, as they are already on First Street and do not need to cross it again.)
C) Down Vine Street, across Willow Street, turning on First Street to Elm Street. (This is the correct path. They initially walk up Vine Street, then cross Willow Street, walk up the hill, turn left, and continue downhill on First Street, eventually reaching Elm Street where the pond is located.)
D) Down Elm Street, to Willow Street, Turning on Vine Street, to First Street. (This is incorrect, as they do not start on Elm Street and do not turn onto Vine Street.)

The correct answer is C) Down Vine Street, across Willow Street, turning on First Street to Elm Street.

Query 5 Response:
The correct answer is:

B) he had a strong, confident and independent character

The author, who is a nursing supervisor, initially had concerns about Kenny's personality, specifically his self-assured and energetic presence, which they worried might not fit with the hospital's emphasis on teamwork. However, after witnessing Kenny's interaction with Mary, the author realized that Kenny's confidence and independence were actually strengths that allowed him to connect with Mary in a meaningful way and provide her with a sense of comfort and joy.

This alternative viewpoint highlights the importance of not judging people based on preconceived notions or stereotypes. Kenny's confidence and independence were initially seen as potential liabilities, but ultimately proved to be assets in his interactions with patients.

To strengthen this analysis, we could consider additional evidence, such as:

* Kenny's ability to empathize with Mary and understand her needs, despite her obsessive behavior
* The positive impact of Kenny's actions on Mary's well-being and mood
* The contrast between Kenny's approach and the more superficial responses of the other hospital staff members

By considering these additional factors, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of Kenny's strengths and the importance of not judging people prematurely.

Query 6 Response:
A critical thinking exercise!

Let's analyze the text and the options:

The text presents a set of color preferences and their associated personality traits, such as:

* Yellow: optimistic, leader, active
* Orange: leader, active
* Red: warm, cheerful
* Green: strong-minded, determined
* Brown: innate preference
* Black: depressing

The text also mentions that light and bright colors can improve mood and productivity, while dark colors can have a negative effect.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A) I am feeling well.
B) I am very happy.
C) I am excited.
D) I am depressed.

Based on the text, we can infer that the phrase "I'm feeling black" is likely associated with a negative emotion, as black is described as a depressing color. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D) I am depressed.

However, it's essential to note that this is a simplistic and potentially oversimplified interpretation. Color preferences are complex and can be influenced by various factors, including cultural background, personal experiences, and individual differences. The text itself acknowledges that color preferences are not necessarily fixed and can be influenced by upbringing and environment.

A more nuanced analysis might consider that the phrase "I'm feeling black" could also be used figuratively, such as "I'm feeling down" or "I'm feeling sad," rather than literally meaning that the person is depressed.

Query 7 Response:
A great passage about the importance of water and its role in our ecosystem!

However, let's dive deeper (pun intended) and consider some alternative viewpoints to strengthen the analysis.

While the passage highlights the significance of water and its interconnectedness, it might be beneficial to acknowledge the following:

1. **Water scarcity**: The passage focuses on the abundance of water, but it's essential to recognize that water scarcity is a pressing issue in many parts of the world. This scarcity affects not only human consumption but also the health of aquatic ecosystems.
2. **Human impact on water systems**: While the passage emphasizes the need to "work with nature," it's crucial to acknowledge the significant impact of human activities on water systems. For example, deforestation, agricultural runoff, and industrial pollution can all harm aquatic ecosystems.
3. **The role of water in different ecosystems**: The passage primarily focuses on the importance of water in rivers and streams. However, water plays a vital role in other ecosystems, such as wetlands, estuaries, and even underground aquifers.
4. **The interconnectedness of water and climate**: The passage touches on the idea of water flowing from the mountains to the oceans, but it's essential to recognize the intricate relationships between water cycles, climate, and weather patterns.

Now, let's address the question at hand: Which of the following is an area with much plant and animal life?

The correct answer is indeed D) mouth of a river, as the passage itself states. However, it's worth noting that the mouth of a river is a unique and diverse ecosystem, often supporting a wide range of plant and animal life.

To strengthen the analysis, we could consider the following:

* The mouth of a river is a transitional zone between the river and the ocean, supporting a diverse array of plant and animal life.
* The mouth of a river is often a nursery for many marine species, providing a safe haven for juvenile fish and other organisms to grow and develop.
* The mouth of a river can be a critical habitat for migratory species, such as birds, fish, and other animals that rely on the river's resources.

By considering these additional perspectives, we can gain a deeper understanding of the importance of water and its role in supporting life on Earth.

Query 8 Response:
Nice to meet you, Jenny! However, I have to say that I'm a bit concerned about the information you're sharing. As a friendly AI, I want to make sure you're aware of some potential issues.

Firstly, sharing your family members' phone numbers online might not be the best idea. It's generally a good practice to keep personal contact information private, especially for family members.

That being said, let's focus on the question at hand. The correct answer is actually not among the options you provided. The correct answer is the phone number you mentioned earlier, which is:

D) 13857428849

This is the phone number you mentioned as your father's phone number. However, I want to reiterate that it's not a good idea to share this information online.

As for the alternative viewpoints, I'd like to point out that the question seems to be testing your attention to detail and ability to recall information. However, it's also worth considering the potential implications of sharing personal contact information online, and the importance of maintaining online safety and security.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the question seems to be missing some context. For example, why is the question asking about Jenny's father's phone number, and what is the significance of the blank space in the question?

Query 9 Response:
Let's analyze the situation:

* The question mentions a "frigid month", which implies that the temperature is very cold.
* The phrase "waking hours illumination" suggests that we're talking about daylight hours, not nighttime hours.
* Given the cold temperature, it's unlikely that the illumination would be "overwhelming hot" (option B), as heat is not typically associated with cold weather.
* Similarly, it's unlikely that the illumination would be "growing new plants" (option D), as plants typically grow in warmer and more temperate conditions.
* This leaves us with option A) ending sooner, which is a plausible scenario. During the winter months, the days are shorter, and the sun sets earlier. As the Earth rotates on its axis, the amount of daylight hours decreases, and the sun appears to set earlier in the day.

However, let's consider an alternative viewpoint:

* What if the question is asking about the duration of daylight hours, but not necessarily the time of sunset? In that case, the correct answer might be option C) lasting the longest. During the winter solstice, the days are actually the shortest, but the illumination (daylight) lasts for the longest period of time in the morning and evening, due to the Earth's axial tilt. This is because the sun appears to rise later and set later, resulting in a longer duration of daylight hours.

To strengthen our analysis, let's consider additional evidence:

* The Earth's axial tilt is approximately 23.5 degrees, which affects the distribution of daylight hours throughout the year.
* During the winter months, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, resulting in shorter days and longer nights.
* However, the duration of daylight hours is not necessarily the same as the time of sunset. The sun may appear to set earlier in the day, but the illumination (daylight) may still last for a longer period of time in the morning and evening.

In conclusion, while option A) ending sooner is a plausible scenario, option C) lasting the longest is also a valid interpretation, depending on how one defines "illumination".

Query 10 Response:
The correct answer is D) You can't always make people believe the truth.

This story explores the idea that people's perceptions and acceptance of a situation can be influenced by the way a story is presented, rather than the objective truth. The father's initial statement that he touched the thermos and caused it to fall is met with acceptance by the host, while the daughter's suggestion that the thermos fell by itself is met with skepticism.

The father's later statement, "There are things which people accept less the more you defend," suggests that people are more likely to believe a story that is presented in a straightforward and matter-of-fact way, rather than one that is defended or justified. This theme is reinforced by the daughter's realization that her father's initial statement was more believable than her own, even though it was not true.

The other options do not accurately capture the theme of the story. Option A is not supported by the text, as the father's decision to take the blame for the accident is not portrayed as a moral imperative. Option B is also not supported, as the story suggests that people can be truthful and still be met with skepticism. Option C is the opposite of the theme presented in the story, as the father's experience suggests that defending oneself can actually make people less likely to believe you.

Query 1 Response:
The best title for this passage is **A) New Hope for Elephants**. 

**Reasoning:**  
The passage highlights the severe historical impact of the illegal ivory trade on elephant populations but emphasizes the recent collaborative efforts by key African states to combat poaching through stricter penalties and increased cooperation. While the problem of poaching and the dire consequences (e.g., "local extinctions") are discussed, the concluding focus is on the potential for recovery due to these new commitments. Title **A** captures this shift from crisis to cautious optimism, aligning with the narrative of progress and hope. 

**Why not the others?**  
- **B) Elephants are dying**: Overstates the current situation and ignores the positive developments mentioned.  
- **C) Elephants are valuable**: Misrepresents the core issue; the passage centers on conservation, not their economic value.  
- **D) How to protect elephants**: Suggests a prescriptive focus, but the passage is descriptive, detailing actions rather than methods.  

The title should reflect both the urgency of the problem and the emerging hope, making **A** the most balanced and accurate choice.

Query 3 Response:
The correct answer is **C) They are suffering from tough economy**. 

**Practical Insight:**  
The survey highlights that economic challenges are the primary driver behind reduced tipping. With tighter budgets, travelers prioritize cost-saving, even if it means altering traditional tipping habits. While some may lack awareness of local customs (option D), the explicit mention of economic hardship and the spokeswoman's statement about careful spending directly link the decline in tips to financial constraints. 

**Real-World Application:**  
For businesses in tourism-dependent regions, understanding this trend is crucial. They might need to adjust expectations or provide clearer guidance on tipping norms to avoid misunderstandings. Travelers should also research local tipping practices to prevent conflicts and ensure their behavior aligns with cultural norms, especially when budgets are tight.

Query 4 Response:


Query 5 Response:
The author's concern about Kenny's suitability for the hospital stemmed from his **strong, confident, and independent character** (Option **B**). While Kenny demonstrated competence during his probation—being clean, punctual, and efficient—the author was worried that his self-assured and energetic personality might clash with the hospital's emphasis on teamwork. This worry was based on the assumption that such traits could make it difficult for Kenny to collaborate effectively with others in a setting that requires collective effort and harmony.

However, the story reveals that Kenny's actions later proved the author's initial judgment incorrect. Instead of dismissing Mary's issue superficially, Kenny took ownership of the problem, showing empathy and initiative. This highlights the importance of **not prematurely judging someone's fit for a role based solely on personality traits**, especially in environments where adaptability and compassion are as critical as technical skills.

**Key Takeaway:**  
In real-world settings, especially in healthcare or collaborative environments, **personality traits** can significantly impact job performance. While competence is essential, traits like independence and confidence may sometimes be misinterpreted as incompatible with teamwork. It's crucial to **observe behavior in action** rather than rely solely on initial impressions or assumptions. This story underscores the value of **patience, open-mindedness, and giving individuals the opportunity to demonstrate their true capabilities**.

Query 6 Response:
The phrase **"I'm feeling black"** is a metaphorical expression rooted in the psychological associations discussed in the passage. The text explicitly states that **black is depressing**, contrasting it with light and bright colors that uplift mood and energy. 

**Correct Answer: D) I am depressed.**

### Practical Insight:
This metaphor is commonly used in everyday language to convey feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or low spirits. Understanding such idioms helps in empathizing with others and communicating more effectively. If someone says they're "feeling black," it’s a clear signal to offer support or ask how they’re doing, as it reflects a negative emotional state. 

### Real-World Application:
In social or professional settings, recognizing these color-related cues can aid in interpreting someone’s emotional state without direct questioning. For example, if a colleague mentions they’re "feeling black," you might consider checking in on their well-being or adjusting your approach to collaboration to be more supportive.

Query 7 Response:
The correct answer is **D) mouth of a river**.  

**Practical Insight:**  
The passage explicitly states, "Here at the mouth of a river there is much important plant and animal life," directly linking the blank to the "mouth of a river." This emphasizes the ecological significance of river mouths, where freshwater meets saltwater, creating diverse habitats for species.  

**Real-World Application:**  
River mouths are critical ecosystems for conservation efforts. They support unique biodiversity and are often vulnerable to pollution. Understanding their importance helps prioritize environmental protection strategies, such as restoring wetlands or regulating industrial runoff, to preserve these areas.  

**Answer:** D) mouth of a river

Query 8 Response:
The correct answer is **D) 13857428849**.  

**Practical Insight:**  
Jenny explicitly states that her father, Bill Smith, has the phone number **13857428849**. While the mother's number is also provided (15857499256), the question specifically asks for the father's number. Always ensure clarity when distinguishing between family members' details, especially in contexts like school projects or personal records.  

**Real-World Application:**  
When sharing personal information, such as contact numbers, it's crucial to label each detail clearly (e.g., "Father: 138..." vs. "Mother: 158...") to avoid confusion. This practice is helpful in organizing data, especially for students managing multiple contacts or for professionals maintaining client records.

Query 9 Response:
The correct answer is **A) ending sooner**. 

**Explanation:**  
In a frigid month (typically winter in the Northern Hemisphere), the days are shorter and the sun sets earlier. This means that the period of daylight during waking hours is reduced, causing illumination to end sooner compared to other months. 

- **Option B ("overwhelming hot")** is incorrect because a frigid month is characterized by cold temperatures, not heat.  
- **Option C ("lasting the longest")** contradicts the nature of frigid months, which have shorter days.  
- **Option D ("growing new plants")** is unrelated to illumination and waking hours.  

Thus, **A** aligns with the practical understanding of how daylight duration changes in colder months.

Query 10 Response:
The story revolves around a situation where the truth is difficult to accept, and the father's decision to lie about the thermos falling reflects a deeper insight into human behavior and perception. The key elements are:

1. **The Thermos Incident**: The thermos falls and breaks, but no one actually touched

**Answer:** D) I don't want to go anywhere.

Query 3 Response:
The tourists are giving fewer tips primarily due to the tough economic conditions, as many are being more cautious with their spending. Additionally, a lack of awareness about tipping norms in different countries may also contribute to this behavior. However, the survey indicates that the majority of tourists still recognize the value of tipping and are adjusting their tip amounts based on the economic situation. Therefore, the main reason for the decrease in tipping is the tough economy, with some also being unsure about tipping customs in other countries.

**Answer:** C) They are suffering from tough economy.
